    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ROM among the
      birches and pines, where we pitched our moving tent, you looked over the
      flat meadow-lands; and through these went a river, slow and almost
      noiseless, wandering in the valley as if there were no necessity of
      arriving anywhere at appointed times. &ldquo;What is the necessity?&rdquo; it said
      softly to any that would listen. And there was none; so that for many days
      the white tent stood among the trees, overlooking the haycocks in the
      meadows. It was enough business in hand to study the philosophy and the
      subtle rhetoric of Still River.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite rose a strangely ruined mountain-side. There was a nobly-poised
      head and plenteous chest, the head three thousand feet nearer the stars&mdash;which
      was little enough from their point of view, no doubt, but to us it seemed
      a symbol of something higher than the stars, something beyond them forever
      waiting and watching.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its feet upward half a mile the mountain was one raw wound. The
      shivered roots and tree-trunks stuck out helplessly from reddish soil,
      boulders were crushed and piled in angry heaps, veins of granite ripped
      open&mdash;the skin and flesh of the mountain tom off with a curse, and
      the bones made a mockery. The wall of the precipice rose far above this
      desolation, and, beyond, the hazy forests went up a mile or more clear to
      the sky-line. The peak stood over all, not with triumph or with shame, but
      with the clouds and stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cloudy day, with rifts of sunlight. An acre of light crept down
      the mountain: so you have seen, on the river-boats at night, the
      search-light feeling, fingering along the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening an Arcadian, an elderly man and garrulous, came up to see
      what it might be that glimmered among his pulp-trees. He was a surprise,
      and not as Arcadian as at first one might presume, for he sold milk and
      eggs and blueberries at a price to make one suddenly rich. His name was
      Fargus, and he it was whose hay-cutter clicked like a locust all day in
      the meadow-lands. He came and made himself amiable beside us, and confided
      anything we might care to know which experience had left with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Tioba,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That's the name of that mountain.&rdquo; And he told
      us the story of one whom he called &ldquo;Jim Hawks,&rdquo; and of the fall of Tioba.
    </p>
    <p>
      She's a skinned mountain [he said]. She got wet inside and slid. Still
      River used to run ten rods further in, and there was a cemetery, too, and
      Jim Hawks's place; and the cemetery's there yet, six rods underground, but
      the creek shied off and went through my plough-land scandalous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Jim Hawks was a get-there kind, with a clawed face&mdash;by a
      wildcat, yes, sir. Tioba got there; and Jim he was a wicked one. I've been
      forty years in this valley, with the Petersons and the Storrses and the
      Merimys at Canada Center, all good, quiet folk. And nothing happened to
      us, for we did nothing to blame, till Jim came, and Tioba ups and drops on
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now look at it, this valley! There've been landslides over beyond in
      Helder's valley, but there's only one in mine. Looks as if the devil gone
      spit on it. It's Jim Hawks's trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      He come one day with a buckboard and a yellow horse, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sell me that land from here up the mountain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who be you?&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Hawks,&rdquo; says he, and that's all he appeared to know about it. And he
      bought the land, and put up a house close to the mountain, so you could
      throw a cat down his chimney if you wanted to, or two cats if you had 'em.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a long, swing-shouldered man, with a light-colored mustache and a
      kind of flat gray eye that you couldn't see into. You look into a man's
      eye naturally to see what his intentions are. Well, Jim Hawks's eye
      appeared to have nothing to say on the subject. And as to that, I told my
      wife it was none of our business if he didn't bring into the valley
      anything but his name and a bit of money sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got his face clawed by a wildcat by being reckless with it; and he ran
      a deer into Helder's back yard once and shot it, and licked Helder for
      claiming the deer. He was the recklessest chap! He swings his fist into
      Helder's face, and he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shoot, if you got a gun. If you hain't, get out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told Jim that was no place to put a house, on account of Tioba dropping
      rocks off herself whenever it rained hard and the soil got mushy. I told
      him Tioba'd as soon drop a rock on his head as into his gridiron.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can't see Canada Center from here. There's a post-office there, and
      three houses, the Petersons', the Storrses' and the Merimys'. Merimy's
      house got a peaked roof on it. I see Jeaney Merimy climb it after her
      kitten a-yowling on the ridge. She wasn't but six years old then, and she
      was gritty the day she was born. Her mother&mdash;she's old Peterson's
      daughter&mdash;she whooped, and I fetched Jeaney down with Peterson's
      ladder. Jeaney Merimy grew up, and she was a tidy little thing. The Storrs
      boys calculated to marry her, one of 'em, only they weren't enterprising;
      and Jeaney ups and goes over to Eastport one day with Jim Hawks&mdash;cuts
      out early in the morning, and asks nobody. Pretty goings on in this
      valley! Then they come back when they were ready, and Jim says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you got to say about it, Merimy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Merimy hadn't nothing to say about it, nor his wife hadn't nothing to say,
      nor Peterson, nor the Storrs boys. Dog-gone it! Nobody hadn't nothing to
      say; that is, they didn't say it to Jim.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was five years ago, the spring they put up the Redman Hotel at
      Helder's. People's come into these parts now thicker'n bugs. They have a
      band that plays music at the Redman Hotel. But in my time I've seen
      sights. The bears used to scoop my chickens. You could hear wildcats 'most
      any night crying in the brush. I see a black bear come down Jumping Brook
      over there, slapping his toes in the water and grunting like a pig. Me, I
      was ploughing for buckwheat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeaney Merimy went over to Eastport with her hair in a braid, and came
      back with it put up like a crow's nest on top of her head. She was a
      nice-looking girl, Jeaney, and born gritty, and it didn't do her any good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I says to Jim: &ldquo;Now, you're always looking for fighting,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;Now,
      me, I'm for peaceable doings. If you're looking for fighting any time, you
      start in beyond me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; says Jim. &ldquo;I'd as soon scrap with a haystack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do know how it would be, doing with a haystack that way, but you take it
      from Jim's point of view, and you see it wouldn't be what he'd care for;
      and you take it from my point of view, and you see I didn't poke into
      Jim's business. That's natural good sense. Only I'm free to say he was a
      wicked one, 'stilling whiskey on the back side of Tioba, and filling up
      the Storrs boys with it, and them gone to the devil off East where the
      railroads are. And laying Peterson to his front door, drunk. My, he didn't
      know any more'n his front door! &ldquo;He's my grandfather,&rdquo; says Jim. &ldquo;That's
      the humor of it&rdquo;&mdash;meaning he was Jeaney's grandfather. And mixing the
      singularest drinks, and putting 'em into an old man named Fargus, as ought
      to known better. My wife she said so, and she knew. I do' know what Jeaney
      Merimy thought, but I had my point of view on that. Jim got drunk himself
      on and off, and went wilder'n a wildcat, and slid over the mountains the
      Lord knows where. Pretty goings on in this valley!
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a good climate if you add it all up and take the average. But
      sometimes it won't rain till you're gray waiting for it, and sometimes it
      will snow so the only way to get home is to stay inside, and sometimes it
      will rain like the bottom fallen out of a tub. The way of it is that when
      you've lived with it forty years you know how to add up and take the
      average.
    </p>
    <p>
      That summer Tioba kept her head out of sight from June to September
      mainly. She kept it done up in cotton, as you might say, and she leaked in
      her joints surprising. She's a queer mountain that way. Every now and then
      she busts out a spring and dribbles down into Still River from a new
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In September they were all dark days and drizzly nights, and there was
      often the two sounds of the wind on Tioba that you hear on a bad night.
      One of 'em is a kind of steady grumble and hiss that's made with the
      pine-needles and maybe the tons of leaves shaking and falling. The other
      is the toot of the wind in the gullies on edges of rock. But if you stand
      in the open on a bad night and listen, you'd think Tioba was talking to
      you. Maybe she is.
    </p>
    <p>
      It come along the middle of September, and it was a bad night, drizzly,
      and Tioba talking double. I went over to the Hawkses' place early to
      borrow lantern-oil, and I saw Jeaney Merimy sitting over the fire alone,
      and the wind singing in the chimney. &ldquo;Jim hasn't come,&rdquo; she says, speaking
      quiet; and she gets me the lantern-oil. After, when I went away, she
      didn't seem to notice; and what with the wind in the chimney, and Jeaney
      sitting alone with her big black eyes staring, and Tioba talking double,
      and the rain drizzling, and the night falling, I felt queer enough to
      expect a ghost to be standing at my gate. And I came along the road, and
      there <i>was</i> one!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sir; she was a woman in a gray, wet cloak, standing at my gate, and a
      horse and buggy in the middle of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mighty!&rdquo; says I, and drops my oil-can smack in the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mr. Hawks live here?&rdquo; she says, seeing me standing like a tomfool in
      the mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;That's his place across the flat half a mile. He
      ain't at home, but his wife is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind blew her cloak around her sharp, and I could see her face, though
      it was more or less dark. She was some big and tall, and her face was
      white and wet with the rain. After a while she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, ma'am. You'd better not&mdash;'Mighty, ma'am!&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;where you
      going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swung herself into the buggy quicker'n women are apt to do, and she
      whops the horse around and hits him a lick, and off he goes, splashing and
      galloping. Me, I was beat. But I got so far as to think if she wasn't a
      ghost, maybe Jim Hawks would as lief she would be, and if she didn't drive
      more careful she'd be liable to oblige him that way. Because it stands to
      reason a woman don't come looking for a man on a bad night, and cut away
      like that, unless she has something uncommon on her mind. I heard the
      buggy-wheels and the splash of the horse dying away; and then there was
      nothing in the night but the drip of the rain and Tioba talking double&mdash;<i>um-hiss,
      toot-toot.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I went into the house, and didn't tell my wife about it, she
      disliking Jim on account of his singular drinks, which had a tidy taste,
      but affecting a man sudden and surprising. My wife she went off to bed,
      and I sat by the fire, feeling like there was more wrong in the world than
      common. And I kept thinking of Jeaney Merimy sitting by herself off there
      beyond the rain, with the wind singing in the chimney, and Tioba groaning
      and tooting over her. Then there was the extra woman looking for Jim; and
      it seemed to me if I was looking for Jim on a dark night, I'd want to let
      him know beforehand it was all peaceable, so there wouldn't be a mistake,
      Jim being a sudden man and not particular. I had the extra woman on my
      mind, so that after some while it seemed to me she had come back and was
      driving <i>splish-splash</i> around my house, though it was only the wind.
      I was that foolish I kept counting how many times she went round the
      house, and it was more than forty; and sometimes she came so close to the
      front door I thought she'd come through it&mdash;<i>bang!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then somebody rapped sudden at the door, and I jumped, and my chair went
      slap under the table, and I says, &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; though I'd rather it would
      have stayed out, and in walks Jim Hawks. &ldquo;'Mighty!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;I thought you
      was a horse and buggy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He picked up my chair and sat in it himself, rather cool, and began to dry
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horse and buggy?&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Looking for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I just nodded, seeing he appeared to know all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw 'em in Eastport,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;I suppose she's over there&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
      his place. &ldquo;Gone down the road! You don't say! Now, I might have known she
      wouldn't do what you might call a rational thing. Never could bet on that
      woman. If there was one of two things she'd be likely to do, she wouldn't
      do either of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;speaking generally, what might she want of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim looks at me kind of absent minded, rubbing his hair the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look at it, Fargus,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It ain't reasonable. Now, she and me,
      we got married about five years ago. And she had a brother named Tom
      Cheever, and Tom and I didn't agree, and naturally he got hurt; not but
      that he got well again&mdash;that is, partly. And she appeared to have
      different ideas from me, and she appeared to think she'd had enough of me,
      and I took that to be reasonable. Now, here she wants me to come back and
      behave myself, cool as you please. And me inquiring why, she acts like the
      country was too small for us both. I don't see it that way myself.&rdquo; And he
      shook his head, stretching his hands out over the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see either end of it,&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;You're a bad one, Jim, a
      downright bad one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. It's Jeaney you mean,&rdquo; he says, looking kind of interested.
      &ldquo;It'll be hell for Jeaney, won't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind and rain was whooping round the house so we could hardly hear
      each other. It was like a wild thing trying to get in, which didn't know
      how to do it, and wouldn't give up; and then you'd hear like something
      whimpering, and little fingers tapping at the window-glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      My opinion of Jim Hawks was that I didn't seem to get on to him, and
      that's my opinion up to now; and it appeared to me then that Jim might be
      the proper explanation himself of anything the extra woman did which
      seemed unreasonable; but I didn't tell him that, because I didn't see
      rightly what it would mean if I said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim got up and stretched his legs. &ldquo;Now, I tell you, Fargus,&rdquo; says he,
      &ldquo;I'm going to put the thing to Jeaney, being a clipper little woman, not
      to say sharp. If it comes to the worst, I daresay Canada Center will give
      us a burying; or if she wants to slide over the mountains with me, there's
      no trouble about it; or if she'd rather go her own way, and me mine,
      that's reasonable; or if she says to do nothing but hold the fort, why,
      that's all right, too, only Canada Center would be likely to take a hand,
      and then there'd surely be trouble, on account of me getting mad. Now, I
      have to say to you, Fargus, that you've been as friendly as a man could
      be, as things are; and maybe you've seen the last of me, and maybe you
      wouldn't mind if you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speaking generally,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you're about right, Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he laughed, and went out, pulling the door to hard against the
      storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day the rain came streaming down, and my cellar was flooded, and the
      valley was full of the noise of the flood brooks. I kept looking toward
      the Hawkses' place, having a kind of notion something would blow up there.
      It appeared to me there was too much gunpowder in that family for the
      house to stay quiet. Besides, I saw Tioba had been dropping rocks in the
      night, and there were new boulders around. One had ploughed through Jim's
      yard, and the road was cut up frightful. The boulder in Jim's yard looked
      as if it might be eight feet high. I told my wife the Hawkses ought to get
      out of there, and she said she didn't care, she being down on Jim on
      account of his mixed drinks, which had a way of getting under a man, I'm
      free to say, and heaving him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four o'clock in the afternoon it come off misty, and I started over
      to tell Jim he'd better get out; and sudden I stops and looks, for there
      was a crowd coming from Canada Center&mdash;the Storrses and the Petersons
      and the Merimys, and the extra woman in a buggy with Henry Hall, who was
      county sheriff then. &ldquo;Well, 'Mighty!&rdquo; says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled up in front of Jim's place, and I took it they were going to
      walk in and settle things prompt. But you see, when I got there, it was
      Jim a-standing by his door with his rifle, and the sheriff and Canada
      Center was squeezing themselves through the gate and Jim shooting off
      sideways at the pickets on his fence. And the sheriff ups and yelled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, you Jim Hawks! That ain't any way to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Jim walks down the road with his rifle over his arm, and Jeaney
      Merimy comes to the door. She looked some mad and some crying, a little of
      both.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hall,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you turn your horse and go back where you come from.
      Maybe I'll see you by and by. The rest of you go back to Canada Center,
      and if Jeaney wants anything of you she'll come and say so. You go, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went. The extra woman drove off with the sheriff, hanging her
      head, and the sheriff saying, &ldquo;You'll have to come to time, Jim Hawks,
      soon or late.&rdquo; Jeaney Merimy sat in the door with her head hung down, too;
      and the only one as ought to have been ashamed, he was walking around
      uppish, like he meant to call down Tioba for throwing rocks into his yard.
      Then Jeaney sees me, and she says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're all down on Jim. There's no one but me to stand up for Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to cry, while Jim cocked his head and looked at her curious. And
      she kept saying, &ldquo;There's no one but me to stand up for Jim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a queer way for her to look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, that night set in, like the one before, with a drizzling rain. It was
      the longest wet weather I ever knew. I kept going to the window to look at
      the light over at the Hawkses' and wonder what would come of it, till it
      made my wife nervous, and she's apt to be sharp when she's nervous, so I
      quit. And the way Tioba talked double that night was terrible&mdash;<i>um-hiss,
      toot-toot</i>, hour after hour; and no sleep for me and my wife, being
      nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do' know what time it was, or what we heard. All I know is, my wife
      jumps up with a yell, and I jumps up too, and I know we were terrible
      afraid and stood listening maybe a minute. It seemed like there was almost
      dead silence in the night, only the um-m went on, but no hissing and no
      tooting, and if there was any sound of the rain or wind I don't recollect
      it. And then, &ldquo;Um!&rdquo; says Tioba, louder and louder and <i>louder!</i> till
      there was no top nor bottom to it, and the whole infernal world went to
      pieces, and pitched me and my wife flat on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first I knew, there was dead silence again; or maybe my hearing was
      upset, for soon after I began to hear the rain buzzing away quietly. Then
      I got up and took a lantern, and my wife grabs me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't going a step!&rdquo; says she, and the upshot was we both went, two
      old folks that was badly scared and bound to find out why. We went along
      the road, looking about us cautious; and of a sudden, where the road ought
      to be, we ran into a bank of mud that went up out of seeing in the night.
      Then my wife sat down square in the road and began a-crying, and I knew
      Tioba had fallen down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there's Tioba, and that's how she looked next morning, only worse&mdash;more
      mushy and generally clawed up, with the rain still falling dismal, and
      running little gullies in the mud like a million snakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to my guess, Jim and Jeaney and the cemetery were about ten rods
      in, or maybe not more than eight. Anyway, I says to Peterson, and he
      agreed with me, that there wasn't any use for a funeral. I says: &ldquo;God
      A'mighty buried 'em to suit himself.&rdquo; It looked like he didn't think much
      of the way Canada Center did its burying, seeing the cemetery was took in
      and buried over again. Peterson and me thought the same on that point. And
      we put up the white stone, sort of on top of things, that maybe you've
      noticed, and lumped the folk in the cemetery together, and put their names
      on it, and a general epitaph; but not being strong on the dates, we left
      them out mostly. We put Jeaney Merimy with her family, but Canada Center
      was singularly united against letting Jim in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You puts his name on no stone with me or mine,&rdquo; says Merimy, and I'm not
      saying but what he was right. Yes, sir; Merimy had feelings, naturally.
      But it seemed to me when a man was a hundred and fifty feet underground,
      more or less, there ought to be some charity; and maybe I had a weakness
      for Jim, though my wife wouldn't hear of him, on account of his drinks,
      which were slippery things. Anyway, I takes a chisel and a mallet, and I
      picks out a boulder on the slide a decent ways from Canada Center's
      monument, and I cuts in it, &ldquo;Jim Hawks&rdquo;; and then I cuts in it an epitaph
      that I made myself, and it's there yet:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <h3>
      HERE LIES JIM HAWKS, KILLED BY ROCKS.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      HE DIDN'T ACT THE WAY HE OUGHT.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      THAT'S ALL I'll SAY OF JIM.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      HERE HE LIES, WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM.=
    </h3>
    <p>
      And I thought that stated the facts, though the second line didn't rhyme
      really even. Speaking generally, Tioba appeared to have dropped on things
      about the right time, and that being so, why not let it pass, granting
      Merimy had a right to his feelings?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, neither Sheriff Hall nor the extra woman showed up in the valley any
      more, so it seemed likely they had heard of Tioba falling, and agreed Jim
      wouldn't be any good, if they could find him. It was two weeks more before
      I saw the sheriff, him driving through, going over to Helder's. I saw him
      get out of his buggy to see the monument, and I went up after, and led him
      over to show Jim's epitaph, which I took to be a good epitaph, except the
      second line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, what do you think he did? Why, he busted out a-haw-hawing ridiculous,
      and it made me mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; says I. &ldquo;What's ailing you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haw-haw!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Jim ain't there! He's gone down the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you're a blamed liar,&rdquo; says I; and the sheriff sobered up,
      being mad himself, and he told me this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim Hawks,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;came into East-port that night, meaning business.
      He routed me out near twelve o'clock, and the lady staying at my house she
      came into it, too, and there we had it in the kitchen at twelve o'clock,
      the lady uncommon hot, and Jim steaming wet in his clothes and rather
      cool. He says: 'I'm backing Jeaney now, and she tells me to come in and
      settle it to let us alone, and she says we'll hand over all we've got and
      leave. That appears to be her idea, and being hers, I'll put it as my
      own.' Now, the lady, if you'd believe it, she took on fearful, and
      wouldn't hear to reason unless he'd go with her, though what her idea was
      of a happy time with Jim Hawks, the way he was likely to act, I give it
      up. But she cried and talked foolish, till I see Jim was awful bored, but
      I didn't see there was much for me to do. Then Jim got up at last, and
      laughed very unpleasant, and he says: 'It's too much bother. I'll go with
      you, Annie, but I think you're a fool.' And they left next morning, going
      south by train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That's what Sheriff Hall said to me then and there. Well, now, I'm an old
      man, and I don't know as I'm particular clever, but it looks to me as if
      God A'mighty and Tioba had made a mistake between 'em. Else how come they
      hit at Jim Hawks so close as that and missed him? And what was the use of
      burying Jeaney Merimy eight rods deep, who was a good girl all her life,
      and was for standing up for Jim, and him leaving her because the extra
      woman got him disgusted? Maybe she'd rather Tioba would light on her, that
      being the case&mdash;maybe she would have; but she never knew what the
      case was.
    </p>
    <p>
      That epitaph is there yet, as you might say, waiting for him to come and
      get under it; but it don't seem to have the right point now, and it don't
      state the facts any more, except the second line, which is more facts than
      rhyme. And Tioba is the messiest-look-ing mountain in these parts. And
      now, I say, Jim Hawks was in this valley little more than a year, and he
      blazed his trail through the Merimy family, and the Storrs family, and the
      Peterson family, and there's Tioba Mountain, and that's his trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, sir; I don't get on to it. I hear Tioba talking double some nights,
      sort of uneasy, and it seems to me she isn't on to it either, and has her
      doubts maybe she throwed herself away. And there's the cemetery six to ten
      rods underground, with a monument to forty-five people on top, and an
      epitaph to Jim Hawks that ain't so, except the second line, there being no
      corpse to fit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canada Center thinks they'd fit Jim to it if he came round again; but they
      wouldn't: for he was a wicked one, but sudden to act, and he was reckless,
      and he kept his luck. For Tioba drawed off and hit at him, slap! and he
      dodged her.

    <h2>
      A MAN FOR A' THAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>OMPANY A was cut
      up at Antietam, so that there was not enough of it left for useful
      purposes, and Deacon Andrew Terrell became a member of Company G, which
      nicknamed him &ldquo;'is huliness.&rdquo; Company A came from Dutchess County. There
      was a little white church in the village of Brewster, and a little white
      house with a meagre porch where that good woman, Mrs. Terrell, had stood
      and shed several tears as the deacon walked away down the street, looking
      extraordinary in his regimentals. She dried her eyes, settled down to her
      sewing in that quiet south window, and hoped he would remember to keep his
      feet dry and not lose the cough drops. That part of Dutchess County was a
      bit of New England spilled over. New England has been spilling over these
      many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon took the cough drops regularly; he kept his gray chin beard
      trimmed with a pair of domestic scissors, and drilling never persuaded him
      to move his large frame with other than the same self-conscious restraint;
      his sallow face had the same set lines. There is something in the Saxon's
      blood that will not let him alter with circumstances, and it is by virtue
      of it that he conquers in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no doorkeeper in the house of God&mdash;the deacon's service in the
      meeting-house at Brewster&mdash;who should come perforce to dwell in the
      tents of wickedness would pretend to like it. Besides, Company G had no
      tents. It came from the lower wards of the great city. Dinkey Cott, that
      thin-legged, stunted, imp-faced, hardened little Bowery sprout, put his
      left fist in the deacon's eye the first day of their acquaintance, and
      swore in the pleasantest manner possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon cuffed him, because he had been a schoolmaster in his day, and
      did not understand how he would be despised for knocking Dinkey down in
      that amateur fashion, and the lieutenant gave them both guard duty for
      fighting in the ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon declared &ldquo;that young man Cott hadn't no moral ideas,&rdquo; and did
      his guard duty in bitterness and strict conscience to the last minute of
      it. Dinkey put his thumb to his nose and offered to show the lieutenant
      how the thing should have been done, and that big man laughed, and both
      forgot about the guard duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinkey had no sense whatever of personal dignity, which was partly what
      the deacon meant by &ldquo;moral ideas,&rdquo; nor reverence for anything above or
      beneath. He did not harbor any special anger, either, and only enough
      malice to point his finger at the elder man, whenever he saw him, and
      snicker loudly to the entertainment of Company G.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinkey's early recollections had to do with the cobblestones of Mulberry
      Bend and bootblacking on Pearl Street. Deacon Terrell's began with a
      lonely farm where there were too many potato hills to hoe, a little
      schoolhouse where arithmetic was taught with a ferrule, a white
      meeting-house where the wrath of God was preached with enthusiasm; both
      seemed far enough away from the weary tramp, tramp, the picket duty, and
      the camp at last one misty night in thick woods on the Stafford hills,
      looking over the Rappahannock to the town of Fredericksburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened there was not clear to Company G. There seemed to be a deal
      of noise and hurrying about, cannon smoke in the valley and cannon smoke
      on the terraces across the valley. Somebody was building pontoon bridges,
      therefore it seemed likely somebody wanted to get across. They were having
      hard luck with the bridges. That was probably the enemy on the ridge
      beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be no end to him, anyway; up and down the valley, mile
      beyond mile, the same line of wooded heights and drifting smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the regiment found itself crossing a shaky pontoon bridge on a
      Saturday morning in the mist and climbing the bank into a most battered
      and tired-looking little town, which was smoldering sulkily with burned
      buildings and thrilling with enormous noise. There they waited for
      something else to happen. The deacon felt a lump in his throat, stopping
      his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out o' me tracks!&rdquo; snickered Dinkey Cott behind him. &ldquo;I'll step on
      yer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinkey had never seemed more impish, unholy and incongruous. They seemed
      to stand there a long time. The shells kept howling and whizzing around;
      they howled till they burst, and then they whizzed. And now and then some
      one would cry out and fall. It was bad for the nerves. The men were
      growling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, cap, give us a chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't my fault, boys. I got to wait for orders, same as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dinkey poked the deacon's legs with the butt of his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, it's rotten, ain't it? Say, cully, my ma don't like me full o'
      holes. How's yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other gripped his rifle tight and thought of nothing in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it five hours that passed, or twenty, or one? Then they started, and
      the town was gone behind their hurrying feet. Over a stretch of broken
      level, rush and tramp and gasping for breath; fences and rocks ahead,
      clumps of trees and gorges; ground growing rougher and steeper, but that
      was nothing. If there was anything in the way you went at it and left it
      behind. You plunged up a hill, and didn't notice it. You dove into a
      gully, and it wasn't there. Time was a liar, obstacles were scared and ran
      away. But half-way up the last pitch ran a turnpike, with a stone wall in
      front that spit fire and came nearer and nearer. It seemed creeping down
      viciously to meet you. Up, up, till the powder of the guns almost burned
      the deacon's face, and the smoke was so thick he could only see the red
      flashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly he was alone. At least there was no one in sight, for
      the smoke was very thick. Company G all dead, or fallen, or gone back.
      There was a clump of brambles to his left. He dropped to the ground, crept
      behind it and lay still. The roar went on, the smoke rolled down over him
      and sometimes a bullet would clip through the brambles, but after a time
      the small fire dropped off little by little, though the cannon still
      boomed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      His legs were numb and his heart beating his sides like a drum. The smoke
      was blowing away down the slope. He lifted his head and peered through the
      brambles; there was the stone wall not five rods away, all lined along the
      top with grimy faces. A thousand rifles within as many yards, wanting
      nothing better than to dig a round hole in him. He dropped his head and
      closed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were so stunned that the slowly lessening cannonade seemed
      like a dream, and he hardly noticed when it had ceased, and he began to
      hear voices, cries of wounded men and other men talking. There was a clump
      of trees to the right, and two or three crows in the treetops cawing
      familiarly. An hour or two must have passed, for the sun was down and the
      river mist creeping up. He lay on his back, staring blankly at the pale
      sky and shivering a little with the chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of men came down and stood on the rocks above. They could probably
      see him, but a man on his back with his toes up was nothing particular
      there. They talked with a soft drawl. &ldquo;Doggonedest clean-up I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hadn't no business to come up heah, yuh know. They come some
      distance, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shuah! We ain't huntin' rabbits. What'd yuh suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist came up white and cold and covered it all over. He could not see
      the wall any longer, though he could hear the voices. He turned on his
      face and crawled along below the brambles and rocks to where the clump of
      trees stood with a deep hollow below them. They were chestnut trees. Some
      one was sitting in the hollow with his back against the roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the rush Dinkey Cott fairly enjoyed himself. The sporting blood in
      him sang in his ears, an old song that the leopard knows, it may be,
      waiting in the mottled shadow, that the rider knows on the race course,
      the hunter in the snow&mdash;the song of a craving that only excitement
      satisfies. The smoke blew in his face. He went down a hollow and up the
      other side. Then something hot and sudden came into the middle of him and
      he rolled back against the roots of a great tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hully gee! I'm plunked!&rdquo; he grumbled disgustedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the time he felt no pain, but his blood ceased to sing in his ears.
      Everything seemed to settle down around him, blank and dull and angry. He
      felt as if either the army of the North or the army of the South had not
      treated him rightly. If they had given him a minute more he might have
      clubbed something worth while. He sat up against a tree, wondered what his
      chance was to pull through, thought it poor, and thought he would sell it
      for a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firing dropped off little by little, and the mist was coming up.
      Dinkey began to see sights. His face and hands were hot, and things seemed
      to be riproaring inside him generally. The mist was full of flickering
      lights, which presently seemed to be street lamps down the Bowery. The
      front windows of Reilly's saloon were glaring, and opposite was
      Gottstein's jewelry store, where he had happened to hit one Halligan in
      the eye for saying that Babby Reilly was his girl and not Dinkey's; and he
      bought Babby a 90-cent gold ring of Gottstein, which proved Halligan to be
      a liar. The cop saw him hit Halligan, too, and said nothing, being his
      friend. And Halligan enlisted in Company G with the rest of the boys, and
      was keeled over in the dark one night on picket duty, somewhere up
      country. All the gang went into Company G. The captain was one of the
      boys, and so was Pete Murphy, the big lieutenant. He was a sort of ward
      sub-boss, was Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reilly, he's soured on me, Pete. I dun-no wot's got the ol' man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lights seemed to grow thick, till everything was ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, come off! Dis ain't de Bowery,&rdquo; he muttered, and started and rubbed
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist was cold and white all around him, ghostly and still, except that
      there was a low, continual mutter of voices above, and now and then a soft
      moan rose up from somewhere. And it seemed natural enough that a ghost
      should come creeping out of the ghostly mist, even that it should creep
      near to him and peer into his face, a ghost with a gray chin beard and
      haggard eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going down,&rdquo; it whispered. &ldquo;Come on. Don't make any noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hully gee!&rdquo; thought Dinkey. &ldquo;It's the Pope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A number of things occurred to him in confusion. The deacon did not see he
      was hit. He said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't no call to spoil 'is luck, if he is country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He blinked a moment, then nodded and whispered hoarsely: &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon crept away into the mist. Dinkey leaned back feebly and closed
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wished I'd die quick. It's rotten luck. Wished I could see Pete.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon crept down about two hundred yards, then stopped and waited for
      the young man Cott. The night was closing in fast A cry in the darkness
      made him shiver. He had never imagined anything could be so desolate and
      sad. He thought he had better see what was the matter with Dinkey. He
      never could make out afterward why it had seemed necessary to look after
      Dinkey. There were hundreds of better men on the slopes. Dinkey might have
      passed him. It did not seem very sensible business to go back after that
      worthless little limb of Satan. The deacon never thought the adventure a
      credit to his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he went back, guiding himself by the darker gloom of the trees against
      the sky, and groped his way down the hollow, and heard Dinkey muttering
      and babbling things without sense. It made the deacon mad to have to do
      with irresponsible people, such as go to sleep under the enemy's rifles
      and talk aloud in dreams. He pulled him roughly by the boots, and he fell
      over, babbling and muttering. Then it came upon the deacon that it was not
      sleep, but fever. He guessed the young man was hit somewhere. They had
      better be going, anyway. The Johnnies must have out a picket line
      somewhere. He slipped his hands under Dinkey and got up. He tried to climb
      out quietly, but fell against the bank. Some one took a shot at the noise,
      spattering the dirt under his nose. He lifted Dinkey higher and went on.
      Dinkey's mutterings ceased. He made no sound at all for a while, and at
      last said huskily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wot's up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hully gee! Wot yer doin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His voice was weak and thin now. He felt as if he were being pulled in two
      in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, ol' man, I won't jolly yer. Les' find Pete. There's a minie ball
      messed up in me stomick awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't far, Dinkey,&rdquo; said the deacon, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he thought of Pete Murphy's red, fleshy face and black, oily mustache.
      It occurred to him that he had noticed most men in Company G, if they fell
      into trouble, wanted to find Pete. He thought he should want to himself,
      though he could not tell why. If he happened to be killed anywhere he
      thought he should like Pete Murphy to tell his wife about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinkey lay limp and heavy in his arms. The wet blackness seemed like
      something pressed against his face. He could not realize that he was
      walking, though in the night, down the same slope to a river called the
      Rappahannock and a town called Fredericksburg. It was strange business for
      him, Deacon Terrell of Brewster, to be in, stumbling down the battlefield
      in the pit darkness, with a godless little brat like Dinkey Cott in his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why godless, if the same darkness were around us all, and the same
      light, while we lived, would come to all in the morning? It was borne upon
      the deacon that no man was elected to the salvation of the sun or
      condemned to the night apart from other men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon never could recall the details of his night's journey, except
      that he fell down more than once, and ran against stone walls in the dark.
      It seemed to him that he had gone through an unknown, supernatural
      country. Dinkey lay so quiet that he thought he might be dead, but he
      could not make up his mind to leave him. He wished he could find Pete
      Murphy. Pete would tell him if Dinkey was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked not one mile, but several, in the blind night Dinkey had long
      been a limp weight. The last thing he said was, &ldquo;Les' find Pete,&rdquo; and that
      was long before.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the deacon saw a little glow in the darkness, and, coming near,
      found a dying campfire with a few flames only flickering, and beside it
      two men asleep. He might have heard the ripple of the Rappahannock, but,
      being so worn and dull in his mind, he laid Dinkey down by the fire and
      fell heavily to sleep himself before he knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he woke Pete Murphy stood near him with a corporal and a guard. They
      were looking for the pieces of Company G. &ldquo;Dead, ain't he?&rdquo; said Pete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon got up and brushed his clothes. The two men who were sleeping
      woke up also, and they all stood around looking at Dinkey in awkward
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's his folks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&rdquo; said the big lieutenant. &ldquo;He ain't got any folks. Tell you what,
      ol' man, I see a regiment drummer somewhere a minute ago. He'll do a roll
      over Dinkey, for luck, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They put Dinkey's coat over his face and buried him on the bank of the
      Rappahannock, and the drummer beat a roll over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they sat down on the bank and waited for the next thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troops were moving back now across the bridge hurriedly. Company G had
      to take its turn. The deacon felt in his pockets and found the cough drops
      and Mrs. Terrell's scissors. He took a cough drop and fell to trimming his
      beard.

    <h2>
      THE GREEN GRASSHOPPER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NY one would have
      called Bobby Bell a comfortable boy&mdash;that is, any one who did not
      mind bugs; and I am sure I do not see why any one should mind bugs, except
      the kind that taste badly in raspberries and some other kinds. It was
      among the things that are entertaining to see Bobby Bell bobbing around
      among the buttercups looking for grasshoppers. Grasshoppers are
      interesting when you consider that they have heads like door knobs or
      green cheeses and legs with crooks to them. &ldquo;Bobbing&rdquo; means to go like
      Bobby Bell&mdash;that is, to go up and down, to talk to one's self, and
      not to hear any one shout, unless it is some one whom not to hear is to
      get into difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the Salem Road from Mr. Atherton Bell's house there were many level
      meadows of a pleasant greenness, as far as Cum-ming's alder swamp; and
      these meadows were called the Bow Meadows. If you take the alder swamp and
      the Bow Meadows together, they were like this: the swamp was mysterious
      and unvisited, except by those who went to fish in the Muck Hole for
      turtles and eels. Frogs with solemn voices lived in the swamp. Herons flew
      over it slowly, and herons also are uncanny affairs. We believed that the
      people of the swamp knew things it was not good to know, like witchcraft
      and the insides of the earth. In the meadows, on the other hand, there
      were any number of cheerful and busy creatures, some along the level of
      the buttercups, but most of them about the roots of the grasses. The
      people in the swamp were wet, cold, sluggish, and not a great many of
      them. The people of the meadows were dry, warm, continually doing
      something, and in number not to be calculated by any rule in Wentworth's
      Arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you see how different were the two, and how it comes about that the
      meadows were nearly the best places in the world to be in, both because of
      the society there, and because of the swamp near at hand and interesting
      to think about. So, too, you see why it was that Bobby Bell could be found
      almost any summer day &ldquo;bobbing&rdquo; for grasshoppers in the Bow Meadows&mdash;&ldquo;bobbing&rdquo;
       meaning to go up and down like Bobby Bell, to talk to one's self and not
      to hear any one shout; and &ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo; being interesting because of
      their heads resembling door knobs or green cheeses, because of the crooks
      in their legs, and because of their extraordinary habit of jumping.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were in Hagar at this time four ladies who lived at a little
      distance from the Salem Road and Mr. Atherton Bell's house, on a road
      which goes over a hill and off to a district called Scrabble Up and Down,
      where huckleberries and sweet fern mostly grow. They were known as the
      Tuttle Four Women, being old Mrs. Tuttle and the three Miss Tuttles, of
      whom Miss Rachel was the eldest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to understand why Miss Rachel and the children of the village
      of Hagar did not get along well together, when you consider how clean she
      was, how she walked so as never to fall over anything, nor took any
      interest in squat tag, nor resembled the children of the village of Hagar
      in any respect. And so you can understand how it was that, when she came
      down the hill that Saturday afternoon and saw Bobby Bell through the bars
      in the Bow Meadows, she did not understand his actions, and disapproved of
      them, whatever they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facts were these: In the first place a green grasshopper, who was
      reckless or had not been brought up rightly, had gone down Bobby's back
      next the skin, where he had no business to be; and naturally Bobby stood
      on his head to induce him to come out. That seems plain enough, for, if
      you are a grasshopper and down a boy's back, and the boy stands on his
      head, you almost always come out to see what he is about; because it makes
      you curious, if not ill, to be down a boy's back and have him stand on his
      head. Any one can see that. And this is the reason I had to explain about
      Miss Rachel, in order to show you why she did not understand it, nor
      understand what followed after.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the next place, Bobby knew that when you go where you have no business
      to, you are sometimes spanked, but usually you are talked to unpleasantly,
      and tied up to something by the leg, and said to be in disgrace. Usually
      you are tied to the sewing machine, and &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; means the corner of the
      sewing-room between the machine and the sofa. It never occurred to him but
      that this was the right and natural order of things. Very likely it is. It
      seemed so to Bobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is difficult to spank a grasshopper properly. And so there was
      nothing to do but to tie him up and talk to him unpleasantly. That seems
      quite simple and plain. But the trouble was that it was a long time since
      Miss Rachel had stood on her head, or been spanked, or tied up to
      anything. This was unfortunate, of course. And when she saw Bobby stand
      violently on his head and then tie a string to a grasshopper, she thought
      it was extraordinary business, and probably bad, and she came up to the
      bars in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bobby!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you naughty boy, are you pulling off that
      grasshopper's leg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bobby thought this absurd. &ldquo;Gasshoppers,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;ithn't any good
      'ith their legth off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was plain enough, too, because grasshoppers are intended to jump, and
      cannot jump without their legs; consequently it would be quite absurd to
      pull them off. Miss Rachel thought one could not know this without trying
      it, and especially know it in such a calm, matter-of-fact way as Bobby
      seemed to do, without trying it a vast number of times; therefore she
      became very much excited. &ldquo;You wicked, wicked boy!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I shall
      tell your father!&rdquo; Then she went off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobby wondered awhile what his father would say when Miss Rachel told him
      that grasshoppers were no good with their legs off. When Bobby told him
      that kind of thing, he generally chuckled to himself and called Bobby &ldquo;a
      queer little chicken.&rdquo; If his father called Miss Rachel &ldquo;a queer little
      chicken,&rdquo; Bobby felt that it would seem strange. But he had to look after
      the discipline of the grasshopper, and it is no use trying to think of two
      things at once. He tied the grasshopper to a mullein stalk and talked to
      him unpleasantly, and the grasshopper behaved very badly all the time; so
      that Bobby was disgusted and went away to leave him for a time&mdash;went
      down to the western end of the meadows, which is a drowsy place. And there
      it came about that he fell asleep, because his legs were tired, because
      the bees hummed continually, and because the sun was warm and the grass
      deep around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rachel went into the village and saw Mr. Atherton Bell on the steps
      of the post-office. He was much astonished at being attacked in such a
      disorderly manner by such an orderly person as Miss Rachel; but he
      admitted, when it was put to him, that pulling off the legs of
      grasshoppers was interfering with the rights of grasshoppers. Then Miss
      Rachel went on her way, thinking that a good seed had been sown and the
      morality of the community distinctly advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parents of other boys stood on the post-office steps in great number,
      for it was near mail-time; and here you might have seen what varieties of
      human nature there are. For some were taken with the conviction that the
      attraction of the Bow Meadows to their children was all connected with the
      legs of grasshoppers; some suspected it only, and were uneasy; some
      refused to imagine such a thing, and were indignant. But they nearly all
      started for the Bow Meadows with a vague idea of doing something, Mr.
      Atherton Bell and Father Durfey leading. It was not a well-planned
      expedition, nor did any one know what was intended to be done. They halted
      at the bars, but no Bobby Bell was in sight, nor did the Bow Meadows seem
      to have anything to say about the matter. The grasshoppers in sight had
      all the legs that rightly belonged to them. Mr. Atherton Bell got up on
      the wall and shouted for Bobby. Father Durfey climbed over the bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that there was no one in the Bow Meadows at this time, except
      Bobby, Moses Durfey, Chub Leroy, and one other. Bobby was asleep, on
      account of the bumblebees humming in the sunlight; and the other three
      were far up the farther side, on account of an expedition through the
      alder swamp, supposing it to be Africa. There was a desperate battle
      somewhere; but the expedition turned out badly in the end, and in this
      place is neither here nor there. They heard Mr. Atherton Bell shouting,
      but they did not care about it. It is more to the point that Father
      Durfey, walking around in the grass, did not see the grasshopper who was
      tied to the mullein stalk and as mad as he could be. For when tied up in
      disgrace, one is always exceedingly mad at this point; but repentance
      comes afterwards. The grasshopper never got that far, for Father Durfey
      stepped on him with a boot as big as&mdash;big enough for Father Durfey to
      be comfortable in&mdash;so that the grasshopper was quite dead. It was to
      him as if a precipice were to fall on you, when you were thinking of
      something else. Then they all went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobby Bell woke up with a start, and was filled with remorse, remembering
      his grasshopper. The sun had slipped behind the shoulder of Windless
      Mountain. There was a faint light across the Bow Meadows, that made them
      sweet to look on, but a little ghostly. Also it was dark in the roots of
      the grasses, and difficult to find a green grasshopper who was dead; at
      least it would have been if he had not been tied to a mullein stalk. Bobby
      found him at last sunk deep in the turf, with his poor legs limp and
      crookless, and his head, which had been like a green cheese or a door
      knob, no longer looking even like the head of a grasshopper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bobby Bell sat down and wept. Miss Rachel, who had turned the corner
      and was half way up to the house of the Tuttle Four Women, heard him, and
      turned back to the bars. She wondered if Mr. Atherton Bell had not been
      too harsh. The Bow Meadows looked dim and mournful in the twilight. Miss
      Rachel was feeling a trifle sad about herself, too, as she sometimes did;
      and the round-cheeked cherub weeping in the wide shadowy meadows seemed to
      her something like her own life in the great world&mdash;not very well
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wath geen!&rdquo; wailed Bobby, looking up at her, but not allowing his
      grief to be interrupted. &ldquo;He wath my geen bug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rachel melted still further, without knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was green?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled down a bar and crawled through. She hoped Mr. Atherton Bell was
      not looking from a window, for it was difficult to avoid making one's self
      amusing to Mr. Atherton Bell. But Bobby was certainly in some kind of
      trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'th dead!&rdquo; wailed Bobby again. &ldquo;He'th thtepped on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Rachel bent over him stiffly. It was hard for one so austerely
      ladylike as Miss Rachel to seem gracious and compassionate, but she did
      pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's a grasshopper!&rdquo; Then more severely: &ldquo;Why did you tie him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bobby's sobs subsided into hiccoughs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'th a disgace. I put him in disgace, and I forgotted him. He went down
      my back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you step on him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N-O-O-O!&rdquo; The hiccoughs rose into sobs again. &ldquo;He wath the geenest
      gasshopper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not strictly true; there were others just as green; but it was a
      generous tribute to the dead and a credit to Bobby Bell that he felt that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was much in all this that Miss Rachel did not understand; but
      she understood enough to feel sharp twinges for the wrong that she had
      done Bobby Bell, and whatever else may be said of Miss Rachel, up to her
      light she was square. In fact, I should say that she had an acute-angled
      conscience. It was more than square; it was one of those consciences that
      you are always spearing yourself on. She felt very humble, and went with
      Bobby Bell to dig a grave for the green grasshopper under the lee of the
      wall. She dug it herself with her parasol, thinking how she must go up
      with Bobby Bell, what she must say to Mr. Atherton Bell, and how painful
      it would be, because Mr. Atherton Bell was so easily amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobby patted the grave with his chubby palm and cooed contentedly. Then
      they went up the hill in the twilight hand in hand.

      THE ENEMIES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE great fluted
      pillars in Ramoth church were taken away. They interfered with the view
      and rental of the pews behind them. Albion Dee was loud and persuasive for
      removing them, and Jay Dee secret, shy and resistant against it. That was
      their habit and method of hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in due season Jay Dee rented the first seat in the pew in front of
      Albion's pew. This was thought to be an act of hostility, subtle,
      noiseless, far-reaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall man, Jay Dee, and wore a wide flapping coat, had flowing
      white hair, and walked with a creeping step; a bachelor, a miser, he had
      gathered a property slowly with persistent fingers; a furtive, meditating,
      venerable man, with a gentle piping voice. He lived on the hill in the old
      house of the Dees, built in the last century by one &ldquo;John Griswold Dee,
      who married Sarah Ballister and begat two sons,&rdquo; who respectively begat
      Jay and Albion Dee; and Albion founded Ironville, three or four houses in
      the hollow at the west of Diggory Gorge, and a bolt and nail factory. He
      was a red-faced, burly man, with short legs and thick neck, who sought
      determined means to ends, stood squarely and stated opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beginnings of the feud lay backward in time, little underground
      resentments that trickled and collected. In Albion they foamed up and
      disappeared. He called himself modern and progressive, and the bolt and
      nail factory was thought to be near bankruptcy. He liked to look men in
      the eyes. If one could not see the minister, one could not tell if he
      meant what he said, or preached shoddy doctrine. As regards all view and
      rental behind him, Jay Dee was as bad as one of the old fluted pillars.
      Albion could not see the minister. He felt the act to be an act of
      hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was progressive, and interested at the time in a question of the
      service, as respected the choir which sang from the rear gallery. It
      seemed to him more determined and effective to hymnal devotion that the
      congregation should rise and turn around during the singing, to the end
      that congregation and choir might each see that all things were done
      decently. He fixed on the idea and found it written as an interlinear to
      his gospels, an imperative codicil to the duty of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the congregation was satiated with change. They had still to make
      peace between their eyes and the new slender pillars, to convince
      themselves by contemplation that the church was still not unstable, not
      doctrinally weaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that Albion Dee stood up sternly and faced the choir
      alone, with the old red, fearless, Protestant face one knows of Luther and
      Cromwell. The congregation thought him within his rights there to bear
      witness to his conviction. Sabbaths came and went in Ramoth peacefully,
      milestones of the passing time, and all seemed well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pseudo-classic architecture is a pale, inhuman allegory of forgotten
      meaning. If buildings like Ramoth church could in some plastic way
      assimilate their communicants, what gargoyles would be about the cornices,
      what wall paintings of patient saints, mystical and realistic. On one of
      the roof cornices of an old church in France is the carved stone face of a
      demon with horns and a forked tongue, and around its eyes a wrinkled smile
      of immense kindness. And within the church is the mural painting of a
      saint, some Beata Ursula or Catherine, with upturned eyes; a likeable
      girl, capable of her saintship, of turning up her eyes with sincerity
      because it fell to her to see a celestial vision; as capable of a blush
      and twittering laugh, and the better for her capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not stated what Albion symbolized. He stood overtopping the bonnets
      and the gray heads of deacons, respected by the pews, popular with the
      choir, protesting his conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the while secretly, with haunch and elbow, he nudged, bumped and
      rubbed the shoulders and silvery head of Jay Dee. It is here claimed that
      he stood there in the conviction that it was his duty so to testify. It is
      not denied that he so bumped and squatted against Jay Dee, cautiously, but
      with relish and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bowed silver head, behind the shy, persistent eyes of Jay Dee, what
      were his thoughts, his purposes, coiling and constricting? None but the
      two were aware of the locked throat grip of the spirit. In the droning
      Sabbath peace the congregation pursued the minister through the
      subdivisions of his text, and dragged the hymn behind the dragging choir.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a June day and the orioles gurgled their warm nesting notes in the
      maples. The boys in the gallery searched the surface of the quiet assembly
      for points of interest; only here and there nodding heads, wavering fans,
      glazed, abstracted eyes. They twisted and yawned. What to them were
      brethren in unity, or the exegesis of a text, as if one were to count and
      classify, prickle by prickle, to no purpose the irritating points of a
      chestnut burr? The sermon drowsed to its close. The choir and Albion rose.
      It was an outworn sight now, little more curious than Monday morning. The
      sunlight shone through the side windows, slanting down over the young,
      worldly and impatient, and one selected ray fell on Jay Dee's hair with
      spiritual radiance, and on Albion's red face, turned choirward for a
      testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Albion gave a guttural shout. He turned, he grasped Jay Dee's
      collar, dragged him headlong into the aisle, and shook him to and fro,
      protesting, &ldquo;You stuck me! I'll teach you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His red face worked with passion; Jay Dee's venerable head bobbed,
      helpless, mild, piteous. The choir broke down. The minister rose with
      lifted hands and open mouth, the gallery in revelry, the body of the
      church in exclamatory confusion. Albion saw outstretched hands
      approaching, left his enemy, and hat in hand strode down the aisle with
      red, glowering face, testifying, &ldquo;He stuck me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jay Dee sat on the floor, his meek head swaying dizzily.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday morning Albion set out for Hamilton down the narrow valley of
      the Pilgrim River. The sudden hills hid him and his purposes from Ramoth.
      He came in time to sit in the office of Simeon Ballister, and Simeon's
      eyes gleamed. He took notes and snuffed the battle afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Witnesses to pin protruding from coat in region adjoining haunch.
      Hum! Affidavits to actual puncture of inflamed character, arguing possibly
      venom of pin. Ha! Hum! Motive of concurrent animosity. A very respectable
      case. I will come up and see your witnesses&mdash;Ha!&mdash;in a day or
      two. Good morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ballister was a shining light in the county courts in those days, but few
      speak of him now. Yet he wrote a Life of Byron, a History of Hamilton
      County, and talked a half century with unflagging charm. Those who
      remember will have in mind his long white beard and inflamed and swollen
      nose, his voice of varied melody. Alien whiskey and natural indolence kept
      his fame local. His voice is silent forever that once rose in the
      court-rooms like a fountain shot with rainbow fancies, in musical
      enchantment, in liquid cadence. &ldquo;I have laid open, gentlemen, the secret
      of a human heart, shadowed and mourning, to the illumination of your
      justice. You are the repository and temple of that sacred light. Not
      merely as a plaintiff, a petitioner, my client comes; but as a worshipper,
      in reverence of your function, he approaches the balm and radiance of that
      steadfast torch and vestal fire of civilization, an intelligent jury.&rdquo;
       Such was Ballister's inspired manner, such his habit of rhythm and climax,
      whenever he found twenty-four eyes fixed on his swollen nose, the fiery
      mesmeric core of his oratory beaconing juries to follow it and discover
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Case of Dee v. Dee came only before a justice of the peace, in the
      Town Hall of Ramoth, and Justice Kernegan was but a stout man with hairy
      ears and round, spectacled, benevolent eyes. Jay Dee brought no advocate.
      His silvery hair floated about his head. His pale eyes gazed in mild
      terror at Ballister. He said it must have been a wasp stung Albion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wasp, sir! Your Honor, does a wasp carry for penetration, for puncture,
      for malignant attack or justifiable defence, for any purpose whatsoever, a
      brass pin of palpable human manufacture, drawn, headed and pointed by
      machinery, such as was inserted in my client's person? Does the defendant
      wish your Honor to infer that wasps carry papers of brass pins in their
      anatomies? I will ask the defendant, whose venerable though dishonored
      head bears witness to his age, if, in his long experience, he has ever met
      a wasp of such military outfit and arsenal? Not a wasp, your Honor, but a
      serpent; a serpent in human form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jay Dee had no answer to all this. He murmured&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sat on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't catch your remark, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; explained the Justice, &ldquo;Jay says Albion's been squatting
      on him, Mr. Ballister, every Sunday for six months. You see, Albion gets
      up when the choir sings, and watches 'em sharp to see they sing correct,
      because his ear ain't well tuned, but his eye's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Justice's round eyes blinked pleasantly. The court-room murmured with
      approval, and Albion started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't interrupt the Court,&rdquo; continued the Justice. &ldquo;You see, Mr.
      Ballister, sometimes Jay says it was a wasp and sometimes he says it was
      because Albion squatted on him, don't you see, bumped him on the ear with
      his elbow. You see, Jay sets just in front of Albion. Now, you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, does it not appear to your Honor that a witness who voluntarily
      offers to swear to two contradictory explanations; first, that the
      operation in question, the puncture or insertion, was performed by a wasp;
      secondly, that, though he did it himself with a pin and in his haste
      allowed that pin in damnatory evidence to remain, it was because, he
      alleges, of my client's posture toward, and intermittent contact with him&mdash;does
      it not seem to your Honor that such a witness is to be discredited in any
      statement he may make?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, really, Mr. Ballister, but you see Albion oughtn't to've squatted
      on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find myself in a singular position. It has not been usual in my
      experience to find the Court a pleader in opposition. I came hoping to
      inform and persuade your Honor regarding this case. I find myself in the
      position of being informed and persuaded. I hope the Court sees no
      discourtesy in the remark, but if the Court is prepared already to discuss
      the case there seems little for me to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Justice looked alarmed. He felt his popularity trembling. It would not
      do to balk the public interest in Ballister's oratory. Doubtless Jay Dee
      had stuck a pin into Albion, but maybe Albion had mussed Jay's hair and
      jabbed his ear, had dragged and shaken him in the aisle at least. The
      rights of it did not seem difficult. They ought not to have acted that
      way. No man has the right to sit on another man's head from the standpoint
      or advantage of his own religious conviction. Nor has a man a right to use
      another man for a pincushion whenever, as it may be, he finds something
      about him in a way that's like a pincushion. But Ballister's oratory was
      critical and important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Kemegan hastily, &ldquo;this Court is in a mighty uncertain state of
      mind. It couldn't make it up without hearing what you were going to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the Court murmured with approval. Ballister rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This case presents singular features. The secret and sunless caverns,
      where human motives lie concealed, it is the function of justice to lay
      open to vivifying light. Not only evil or good intentions are moving
      forces of apparent action, but mistakes and misjudgments. I conclude that
      your Honor puts down the defendant's fanciful and predatory wasp to the
      defendant's neglect of legal advice, to his feeble and guilty inepitude. I
      am willing to leave it there. I assume that he confesses the assault on my
      client's person with a pin, an insidious and lawless pin, pointed with
      cruelty and propelled with spite; I infer and understand that he offers in
      defence a certain alleged provocation, certain insertions of my client's
      elbow into the defendant's ear, certain trespasses and disturbance of the
      defendant's hair, finally, certain approximations and contacts between my
      client's adjacent quarter and the defendant's shoulders, denominated by
      him&mdash;and here we demur or object&mdash;as an act of sitting or
      squatting, whereby the defendant alleges himself to have been touched,
      grieved and annoyed. In the defendant's parsimonious neglect of counsel we
      generously supply him with a fair statement of his case. I return to my
      client.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honor, what nobler quality is there in our defective nature than
      that which enables the earnest man, whether as a citizen or in divine
      worship, whether in civil matters or religious, to abide steadfastly by
      his conscience and convictions. He stands a pillar of principle, a rock in
      the midst of uncertain waters. The feeble look up to him and are
      encouraged, the false and shifty are ashamed. His eye is fixed on the
      future. Posterity shall judge him. Small matters of his environment escape
      his notice. His mind is on higher things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not prepared to forecast the judgment of posterity on that point of
      ritualistic devotion to which my client is so devoted an advocate. Neither
      am I anxious or troubled to seek opinion whether my client inserted his
      elbow into the defendant's ear, or the defendant, maliciously or
      inadvertently, by some rotatory motion, applied, bumped or banged his ear
      against my client's elbow; whether the defendant rubbed or impinged with
      his head on the appendant coat tails of my client, or the reverse. I am
      uninterested in the alternative, indifferent to the whole matter. It seems
      to me an academic question. If the defendant so acted, it is not the
      action of which we complain. If my client once, twice, or even at sundry
      times, in his stern absorption, did not observe what may in casual
      accident have taken place behind, what then? I ask your Honor, what then?
      Did the defendant by a slight removal, by suggestion, by courteous
      remonstrance, attempt to obviate the difficulty? No! Did he remember those
      considerate virtues enjoined in Scripture, or the sacred place and
      ceremony in which he shared? No! Like a serpent, he coiled and waited. He
      hid his hypocrisy in white hairs, his venomous purpose in attitudes of
      reverence. He darkened his morbid malice till it festered, corroded,
      corrupted. He brooded over his fancied injury and developed his base
      design. Resolved and prepared, he watched his opportunity. With brazen and
      gangrened pin of malicious point and incensed propulsion, with averted eye
      and perfidious hand, with sudden, secret, backward thrust, with all the
      force of accumulated, diseased, despicable spite, he darted like a
      serpent's fang this misapplied instrument into the unprotected posterior,
      a sensitive portion, most outlying and exposed, of my client's person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This action, your Honor, I conceive to be in intent and performance a
      felonious, injurious and sufficient assault. For this injury, for pain,
      indignity and insult, for the vindication of justice in state and
      community, for the protection of the citizen from bold or treacherous
      attack, anterior or posterior, vanguard or rear, I ask your Honor that
      damages be given my client adequate to that injury, adequate to that
      vindication and protection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So much and more Ballister spoke. Mr. Kernegan took off his spectacles and
      rubbed his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I guess Mr. Ballister'll charge Albion about forty
      dollars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ballister started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't interrupt the Court. It's worth all that. Albion and Jay haven't
      been acting right and they ought to pay for it between 'em. The Court
      decides Jay Dee shall pay twenty dollars damages and costs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The court-room murmured with approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The twilight was gathering as Albion drove across the old covered bridge
      and turned into the road that leads to Ironville through a gloomy gorge of
      hemlock trees and low-browed rocks. The road keeps to the left above
      Diggory Brook, which murmurs in recesses below and waves little ghostly
      white garments over its waterfalls. Such is this murmur and the soft noise
      of the wind in the hemlocks, that the gorge is ever filled with a sound of
      low complaint. Twilight in the open sky is night below the hemlocks. At
      either end of the avenue you note where the light still glows fadingly.
      There lie the hopes and possibilities of a worldly day, skies, fields and
      market-places, to-days, to-morrows and yesterdays, and men walking about
      with confidence in their footing. But here the hemlocks stand beside in
      black order of pillars and whisper together distrustfully. The man who
      passes you is a nameless shadow with an intrusive, heavy footfall. Low
      voices float up from the pit of the gorge, intimations, regrets,
      discouragements, temptations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A house and mill once stood at the lower end of it, and there, a century
      ago, was a wild crime done on a certain night; the dead bodies of the
      miller and his children lay on the floor, except one child, who hid and
      crept out in the grass; little trickles of blood stole along the cracks;
      house and mill blazed and fell down into darkness; a maniac cast his
      dripping axe into Diggory Brook and fled away yelling among the hills. Not
      that this had made the gorge any darker, or that its whispers are supposed
      to relate to any such memories. The brook comes from swamps and meadows
      like other brooks, and runs into the Pilgrim River. It is shallow and
      rapid, though several have contrived to fall and be drowned in it. One
      wonders how it could have happened. The old highway leading from Ramoth
      village to the valley has been grass-grown for generations, but that is
      because the other road is more direct to the Valley settlement and the
      station. The water of the brook is clear and pleasant enough. Much
      trillium, with its leaves like dark red splashes, a plant of sullen color
      and solitary station, used to grow there, but does so no more. Slender
      birches now creep down almost to the mouth of the gorge, and stand with
      white stems and shrinking, trembling leaves. But birches grow nearly
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albion drove steadily up the darkened road, till his horse dropped into a
      walk behind an indistinguishable object that crept in front with creaking
      wheels. He shouted for passage and turned into the ditch on the side away
      from the gorge. The shadowy vehicle drifted slantingly aside. Albion
      started his horse; the front wheels of the two clicked, grated, slid
      inside each other and locked. Albion spoke impatiently. He was ever for
      quick decisions. He backed his horse, and the lock became hopeless. The
      unknown made no comment, no noise. The hemlocks whispered, the brook
      muttered in its pit and shook the little white garments of its waterfalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crank your wheel a trifle now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? Can't ye speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albion leaned over his wheel, felt the seat rail of the other vehicle, and
      brought his face close to something white&mdash;white hair about the
      approximate outline of a face. By the hair crossed by the falling hat
      brim, by the shoulders seen vaguely to be bent forward, by the loose
      creaking wheels of the buck-board he knew Jay Dee. The two stood close and
      breathless, face to face, but featureless and apart by the unmeasured
      distance of obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albion felt a sudden uneasy thrill and drew back. He dreaded to hear Jay
      Dee's spiritless complaining voice, too much in the nature of that dusky,
      uncanny place. He felt as if something cold, damp and impalpable were
      drawing closer to him, whispering, calling his attention to the gorge, how
      black and steep! to the presence of Jay Dee, how near! to the close secret
      hemlocks covering the sky. This was not agreeable to a positive man, a man
      without fancies. Jay Dee sighed at last, softly, and spoke, piping, thin,
      half-moaning:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're following me. Let me alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not following you,&rdquo; said Albion hoarsely. &ldquo;Crank your wheel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're following me. I'm an old man. You're only fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albion breathed hard in the darkness. He did not understand either Jay Dee
      or himself. After a silence Jay Dee went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any kin but you, Albion, except Stephen Ballister and the
      Winslows. They're only fourth cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albion growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without my making a will it'd come to you, wouldn't it? Seems to me as if
      you oughtn't to pester me, being my nearest kin, and me, I ain't made any
      will. I got a little property, though it ain't much. 'Twould clear your
      mortgage and make you easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty dollars and costs,&rdquo; moaned Jay Dee. &ldquo;And me an old man, getting
      ready for his latter end soon. I ain't made my will, either. I ought to've
      done it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could Jay Dee mean? If he made no will his property would come to
      Albion. No will made yet. A hinted intention to make one in favor of
      Stephen Ballister or the Winslows. The foundry was mortgaged.&mdash;Jay
      was worth sixty thousand. Diggory Gorge was a dark whispering place of
      ancient crime, of more than one unexplained accident. The hemlocks
      whispered, the brook gurgled and glimmered. Such darkness might well cloak
      and cover the sunny instincts that look upwards, scruples of the social
      daylight. Would Jay Dee trap him to his ruin? Jay Dee would not expect to
      enjoy it if he were dead himself. But accidents befall, and men not seldom
      meet sudden deaths, and an open, free-speaking neighbor is not suspected.
      Success lies before him in the broad road.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rushed through Albion's mind, a flood, sudden, stupefying&mdash;thoughts
      that he could not master, push back, or stamp down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started and roused himself; his hands were cold and shaking. He sprang
      from his buggy and cried angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d'ye mean by all that? Tempt me, a God-fearing man? Throw ye off'n
      the gorge! Break your old neck! I've good notion to it, if I wasn't a
      God-fearing man. Crank your wheel there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jerked his buggy free, sprang in, and lashed his horse. The horse
      leaped, the wheels locked again. Jay Dee's buckboard, thrust slanting
      aside, went over the edge, slid and stopped with a thud, caught by the
      hemlock trunks. A ghostly glimmer of white hair one instant, and Jay Dee
      was gone down the black pit of the gorge. A wheezing moan, and nothing
      more was heard in the confusion. Then only the complaining murmur of the
      brook, the hemlocks at their secrets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jay! Jay!&rdquo; called Albion, and then leaped out, ran and whispered, &ldquo;Jay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only the mutter of the brook and the shimmer of foam could be made out as
      he stared and listened, leaning over, clinging to a tree, feeling about
      for the buckboard. He fumbled, lit a match and lifted it. The seat was
      empty, the left wheels still in the road. The two horses, with twisted
      necks and glimmering eyes, were looking back quietly at him, Albion Dee, a
      man of ideas and determination, now muttering things unintelligible in the
      same tone with the muttering water, with wet forehead and nerveless hands,
      heir of Jay Dee's thousands, staring down the gorge of Diggory Brook, the
      scene of old crime. He gripped with difficulty as he let himself slide
      past the first row of trees, and felt for some footing below. He noticed
      dully that it was a steep slope, not a precipice at that point. He lit
      more matches as he crept down, and peered around to find something crushed
      and huddled against some tree, a lifeless, fearful thing. The slope grew
      more moderate. There were thick ferns. And closely above the brook, that
      gurgled and laughed quietly, now near at hand, sat Jay Dee. He looked up
      and blinked dizzily, whispered and piped:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty dollars and costs! You oughtn't to pester me. I ain't made my
      will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Albion sat down. They sat close together in the darkness some moments and
      were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't hurt?&rdquo; Albion asked at last. &ldquo;We'll get out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went up the steep, groping and stumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albion half lifted his enemy into the buckboard, and led the horse, his
      own following. They were out into the now almost faded daylight. Jay sat
      holding his lines, bowed over, meek and venerable. The front of his coat
      was torn. Albion came to his wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will twenty dollars make peace between you and me, Jay Dee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The costs was ten,&rdquo; piping sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty dollars, Jay Dee? Here it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped into his buggy and drove rapidly. In sight of the foundry he
      drew a huge breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I been a sinner and a fool,&rdquo; and slapped his knee. &ldquo;It's sixty thousand
      dollars, maybe seventy. A self-righteous sinner and a cocksure fool. God
      forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Between eight and nine Jay Dee sat down before his meagre fire and rusty
      stove, drank his weak tea and toasted his bread. The windows clicked with
      the night wind. The furniture was old, worn, unstable, except the large
      desk behind him full of pigeonholes and drawers. Now and then he turned
      and wrote on scraps of paper. Tea finished, he collected the scraps and
      copied:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Stephen Ballister: I feel, as growing somewhat old, I ought to make my
      will, and sometime, leaving this world for a better, would ask you to make
      my will for me, for which reasonable charge, putting this so it cannot be
      broken by lawyers, who will talk too much and are vain of themselves, that
      is, leaving all my property of all kinds to my relative, James Winslow of
      Wimberton, and not anything to Albion Dee; for he has not much sense but
      is hasty; for to look after the choir is not his business, and to sit on
      an old man and throw him from his own wagon and pay him thirty dollars is
      hasty, for it is not good sense, and not anything to Stephen Ballister,
      for he must be rich with talking so much in courts of this world. Put this
      all in my will, but if unable or unwilling on account of remorse for
      speaking so in the court, please to inform that I may get another lawyer.
      Yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      Jay Dee.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sealed and addressed the letter, put it in his pocket, and noticed the
      ruinous rent in his coat. He sighed, murmured over it complainingly, and
      turned up the lapel of the coat. Pins in great variety and number were
      there in careful order, some new, some small, some long and old and
      yellow. He selected four and pinned the rent together, sighing. Then he
      took three folded bills from his vest pocket, unfolded, counted and put
      them back, felt of the letter in his coat gently, murmured, &ldquo;I had the
      best of Albion there; I had him there,&rdquo; took his candle and went up
      peacefully and venerably to bed.

    <h2>
      A NIGHT'S LODGING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ATHER WILISTON was
      a retired clergyman, so distinguished from his son Timothy, whose house
      stood on the ridge north of the old village of Win-throp, and whose daily
      path lay between his house and the new growing settlement around the
      valley station. It occurred at odd times to Father Wiliston that Timothy's
      path was somewhat undeviating. The clergyman had walked widely since
      Win-throp was first left behind fifty-five years back, at a time when the
      town was smaller and cows cropped the Green but never a lawn mower.
    </p>
    <p>
      After college and seminary had come the frontier, which lay this side of
      the Great Lakes until Clinton stretched his ribbon of waterway to the sea;
      then a mission in Wisconsin, intended to modify the restless profanity of
      lumbermen who broke legs under logs and drank disastrous whiskey. A city
      and twenty mills were on the spot now, though the same muddy river ran
      into the same blue lake. Some skidders and saw-tenders of old days were
      come to live in stone mansions and drive in nickel-plated carriages; some
      were dead; some drifting like the refuse on the lake front; some skidding
      and saw-tending still. Distinction of social position was an idea that
      Father Wiliston never was able to grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the memories of that raw city on the lake he had his place among its
      choicest incongruities; and when his threescore and ten years were full,
      the practical tenderness of his nickel-plated and mansioned parishioners
      packed him one day into an upholstered sleeping car, drew an astonishing
      check to his credit, and mailed it for safety to Timothy Wiliston of
      Winthrop. So Father Wiliston returned to Winthrop, where Timothy, his son,
      had been sent to take root thirty years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      One advantage of single-mindedness is that life keeps on presenting us
      with surprises. Father Wiliston occupied his own Arcadia, and Wisconsin or
      Winthrop merely sent in to him a succession of persons and events of
      curious interest. &ldquo;The parson&rdquo;&mdash;Wisconsin so spoke of him, leaning
      sociably over its bar, or pausing among scented slabs and sawdust&mdash;&ldquo;the
      parson resembles an egg as respects that it's innocent and some lopsided,
      but when you think he must be getting addled, he ain't. He says to me,
      'You'll make the Lord a deal of trouble, bless my soul!' he says. I don't
      see how the Lord's going to arrange for you. But'&mdash;thinking he might
      hurt my feelings&mdash;'I guess he'll undertake it by and by.' Then he
      goes wabbling down-street, picks up Mike Riley, who's considerable drunk,
      and takes him to see his chickens. And Mike gets so interested in those
      chickens you'd like to die. Then parson goes off, absent-minded and
      forgets him, and Mike sleeps the balmy night in the barnyard, and steals a
      chicken in the morning, and parson says, 'Bless my soul! How singular!'
      Well,&rdquo; concluded Wisconsin, &ldquo;he's getting pretty young for his years. I
      hear they're going to send him East before he learns bad habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steadiness and repetition of Timothy's worldly career and semi-daily
      walk to and from his business therefore seemed to Father Wiliston
      phenomenal, a problem not to be solved by algebra, for if <i>a</i>
      equalled Timothy, <i>b</i> his house, <i>c</i> his business, <i>a + b + c</i>
      was still not a far-reaching formula, and there seemed no advantage in
      squaring it. Geometrically it was evident that by walking back and forth
      over the same straight line you never so much as obtained an angle. Now,
      by arithmetic, &ldquo;Four times thirty, multiplied by&mdash;leaving out Sundays&mdash;Bless
      me! How singular! Thirty-seven thousand five hundred and sixty times!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if it had ever occurred to Timothy to walk it backward, or,
      perhaps, to hop, partly on one foot, and then, of course, partly on the
      other. Sixty years ago there was a method of progress known as
      &ldquo;hop-skip-and-jump,&rdquo; which had variety and interest. Drawn in the train of
      this memory came other memories floating down the afternoon's slant
      sunbeams, rising from every meadow and clump of woods; from the elder
      swamp where the brown rabbits used to run zigzag, possibly still ran in
      the same interesting way; from the great sand bank beyond the Indian
      graves. The old Wiliston house, with roof that sloped like a well-sweep,
      lay yonder, a mile or two. He seemed to remember some one said it was
      empty, but he could not associate it with emptiness. The bough apples
      there, if he remembered rightly, were an efficacious balm for regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed and took up his book. It was another cure for regret, a Scott
      novel, &ldquo;The Pirate.&rdquo; It had points of superiority over Cruden's
      Concordance. The surf began to beat on the Shetland Islands, and trouble
      was imminent between Cleveland and Mor-daunt Mertoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Timothy and his wife drove away visiting that afternoon, not to return
      till late at night, and Bettina, the Scandinavian, laid Father Wiliston's
      supper by the open window, where he could look out across the porch and
      see the chickens clucking in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mus' eat, fater,&rdquo; she commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Bettina. Thank you, my dear. Quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came with his book and sat down at the table, but Bettina was
      experienced and not satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mus' eat firs'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed and laid down &ldquo;The Pirate.&rdquo; Bettina captured and carried it to
      the other end of the room, lit the lamp though it was still light, and
      departed after the mail. It was a rare opportunity for her to linger in
      the company of one of her Scandinavian admirers. &ldquo;Fater&rdquo; would not know
      the difference between seven and nine or ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned in the window and watched her safely out of sight, then went
      across the room, recaptured &ldquo;The Pirate,&rdquo; and chuckled in the tickling
      pleasure of a forbidden thing, &ldquo;asked the blessing,&rdquo; drank his tea
      shrewdly, knowing it would deteriorate, and settled to his book. The brown
      soft dusk settled, shade by shade; moths fluttered around the lamp; sleepy
      birds twittered in the maples. But the beat of the surf on the Shetland
      Islands was closer than these. Cleveland and Mordaunt Mertoun were busy,
      and Norna&mdash;&ldquo;really, Norna was a remarkable woman&rdquo;&mdash;and an hour
      slipped past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one hemmed! close by and scraped his feet. It was a large man who
      stood there, dusty and ragged, one boot on the porch, with a red
      handkerchief knotted under his thick tangled beard and jovial red face. He
      had solid limbs and shoulders, and a stomach of sloth and heavy feeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger did not resemble the comely pirate, Cleveland; his linen was
      not &ldquo;seventeen hun'red;&rdquo; it seemed doubtful if there were any linen. And
      yet, in a way there was something not inappropriate about him, a certain
      chaotic ease; not piratical, perhaps, although he looked like an
      adventurous person. Father Wiliston took time to pass from one conception
      of things to another. He gazed mildly through his glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't had no supper,&rdquo; began the stranger in a deep moaning bass; and
      Father Wiliston started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul! Neither have I.&rdquo; He shook out his napkin. &ldquo;Bettina, you
      see &ldquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like there's enough for two,&rdquo; moaned and grumbled the other. He
      mounted the porch and approached the window, so that the lamplight
      glimmered against his big, red, oily face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so there is!&rdquo; cried Father Wiliston, looking about the table in
      surprise. &ldquo;I never could eat all that. Come in.&rdquo; And the stranger rolled
      muttering and wheezing around through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not bring a chair? And you might use the bread knife. These are
      fried eggs. And a little cold chicken? Really, I'm very glad you dropped
      in, Mr.&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Del Toboso.&rdquo; By this time the stranger's mouth was full and his
      enunciation confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&rdquo;&mdash;Father Wiliston helped himself to an egg&mdash;&ldquo;I don't think
      I caught the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Del Toboso. Boozy's what they calls me in the push.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid your tea is quite cold. Boozy? How singular! I hope it doesn't
      imply alcoholic habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; shaking his head gravely, so that his beard wagged to the judicial
      negation. &ldquo;Takes so much to tank me up I can't afford it, let alone it
      ain't moral.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two ate with haste, the stranger from habit and experience, Father
      Wiliston for fear of Bettina's sudden return. When the last egg and slice
      of bread had disappeared, the stranger sat back with a wheezing sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; began Father Wiliston mildly, &ldquo;Mr. Toboso&mdash;Toboso is the
      last name, isn't it, and Del the first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; the other wheezed mysteriously, &ldquo;I don't know about that, Elder.
      That's always a question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know! You don't know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got it off'n another man,&rdquo; went on Toboso sociably. &ldquo;He said he wouldn't
      take fifty dollars for it. I didn't have no money nor him either, and he
      rolled off'n the top of the train that night or maybe the next I don't
      know. I didn't roll him. It was in Dakota, over a canyon with no special
      bottom. He scattered himself on the way down. But I says, if that name's
      worth fifty dollars, it's mine. Del Toboso. That's mine. Sounds valuable,
      don't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston fell into a reverie. &ldquo;To-boso? Why, yes. Dulcinea del
      Toboso. I remember, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that? Dulcinea, was it? And you knowed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long while ago when I was younger. It was in a green cover. 'Don
      Quixote'&mdash;he was in a cage, 'The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.'
      He had his face between the bars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Toboso, &ldquo;you must have knowed him. He always looked glum, and
      I've seen him in quad myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Sancho Panza. Dulcinea del Toboso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never knowed that part of it. Dulcinea del Toboso! Well, that's me. You
      know a ruck of fine names, Elder. It sounds like thirteen trumps, now,
      don't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston roused himself, and discriminated. &ldquo;But you look more like
      Sancho Panza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do? Well, I never knowed that one. Must've been a Greaser. Dulcinea's
      good enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston began to feel singularly happy and alive. The regular and
      even paced Timothy, his fidgeting wife, and the imperious Bettina were to
      some extent shadows and troubles in the evening of his life. They were
      careful people, who were hemmed in and restricted, who somehow hemmed in
      and restricted him. They lived up to precedents. Toboso did not seem to
      depend on precedents. He had the free speech, the casual inconsequence,
      the primitive mystery, desired of the boy's will and the wind's will, and
      travelled after by the long thoughts of youth. He was wind-beaten, burned
      red by the sun, ragged of coat and beard, huge, fat, wallowing in the ease
      of his flesh. One looked at him and remembered the wide world full of
      crossed trails and slumbering swamps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston had long, straight white hair, falling beside his
      pale-veined and spiritual forehead and thin cheeks. He propped his
      forehead on one bony hand, and looked at Toboso with eyes of speculation.
      If both men were what some would call eccentric, to each other they seemed
      only companionable, which, after all, is the main thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of late,&rdquo; continued Father Wiliston after a pause, &ldquo;that I
      should like to travel, to examine human life, say, on the highway. I
      should think, now, your manner of living most interesting. You go from
      house to house, do you not?&mdash;from city to city? Like Ulysses, you see
      men and their labors, and you pass on. Like the apostles&mdash;who surely
      were wise men, besides that were especially maintained of God&mdash;like
      them, and the pilgrims to shrines, you go with wallet and staff or merely
      with Faith for your baggage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There don't nothing bother you in warm weather, that's right,&rdquo; said
      Toboso, &ldquo;except your grub. And that ain't any more than's interesting. If
      it wasn't for looking after meals, a man on the road might get right down
      lazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, just so! How wonderful! Now, do you suppose, Mr. Toboso, do you
      suppose it feasible? I should very much like, if it could be equably
      arranged, I should very much like to have this experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toboso reflected. &ldquo;There ain't many of your age on the road.&rdquo; An idea
      struck him suddenly. &ldquo;But supposing you were going sort of experimenting,
      like that&mdash;and there's some folks that do&mdash;supposing you could
      lay your hands on a little bunch of money for luck, I don't see nothing to
      stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I think there is some in my desk.&rdquo; Toboso leaned forward and pulled
      his beard. The table creaked under his elbow. &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see. Of course you are quite right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your age, Elder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not as if I were younger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston rose and hurried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toboso sat still and blinked at the lamp. &ldquo;My Gord!&rdquo; he murmured and
      moaned confidentially, &ldquo;here's a game!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After some time Father Wiliston returned. &ldquo;Do you think we could start
      now?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why sure, Elder. What's hindering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fortunate to find sixty dollars. Really, I didn't remember. And
      here's a note I have written to my son to explain. I wonder what Bettina
      did with my hat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hurried back into the hall. Toboso took the note from the table and
      pocketed it. &ldquo;Ain't no use taking risks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out into the warm night, under pleasant stars, and along the
      road together arm in arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel pretty gay, Elder.&rdquo; He broke into bellowing song, &ldquo;Hey, Jinny! Ho,
      Jinny! Listen, love, to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, I feel cheerful, too, Mr. Toboso, wonderfully cheerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dulcinea, Elder. Dulcinea's me name. Hey, Jinny! Ho, Jinny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How singular it is! I feel very cheerful. I think&mdash;really, I think I
      should like to learn that song about Jinny. It seems such a cheerful
      song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hit her up, Elder,&rdquo; wheezed Toboso jovially. &ldquo;Now then&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Jinny! Ho, Jinny! Listen, love, to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went arm in arm with a roaring and a tremulous piping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lamp flickered by the open window as the night breeze rose. Bettina
      came home betimes and cleared the table. The memory of a Scandinavian
      caress was too recent to leave room for her to remark that there were
      signs of devastating appetite, that dishes had been used unaccountably,
      and that &ldquo;Fater&rdquo; had gone somewhat early to bed. Timothy and his wife
      returned late. All windows and doors in the house of Timothy were closed,
      and the last lamp was extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston and Toboso went down the hill, silently, with furtive,
      lawless steps through the cluster of houses in the hollow, called
      Ironville, and followed then the road up the chattering hidden brook. The
      road came from the shadows of this gorge at last to meadows and wide
      glimmering skies, and joined the highway to Redfield. Presently they came
      to where a grassy side road slipped into the highway from the right, out
      of a land of bush and swamp and small forest trees of twenty or thirty
      years' growth. A large chestnut stood at the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Jinny!&rdquo; wheezed Toboso. &ldquo;Let's look at that tree, Elder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at it? Yes, yes. What for?&rdquo; Toboso examined the bark by the dim
      starlight; Father Wiliston peered anxiously through his glasses to where
      Toboso's finger pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See those marks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I don't. Really, I'm sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Feel 'em, then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Father Wiliston felt, with eager, excited finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them there mean there's lodging out here; empty house, likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they, indeed. Very singular! Most interesting!&rdquo; And they turned into
      the grassy road. The brushwood in places had grown close to it, though it
      seemed to be still used as a cart path. They came to a swamp, rank with
      mouldering vegetation, then to rising ground where once had been meadows,
      pastures, and plough lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston was aware of vaguely stirring memories. Four vast and aged
      maple trees stood close by the road, and their leaves whispered to the
      night; behind them, darkly, was a house with a far sloping roof in the
      rear. The windows were all glassless, all dark and dead-looking, except
      two in a front room, in which a wavering light from somewhere within
      trembled and cowered. They crept up, and looking through saw tattered wall
      paper and cracked plaster, and two men sitting on the floor, playing cards
      in the ghostly light of a fire of boards in the huge fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Jinny!&rdquo; roared Toboso, and the two jumped up with startled oaths.
      &ldquo;Why, it's Boston Alley and the Newark Kid!&rdquo; cried Toboso. &ldquo;Come on,
      Elder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger man cast forth zigzag flashes of blasphemy. &ldquo;You big fat fool!
      Don't know no mor' 'n to jump like that on <i>me!</i> Holy Jims! I ain't
      made of copper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toboso led Father Wiliston round by the open door. &ldquo;Hold your face, Kid.
      Gents, this here's a friend of mine we'll call the Elder, and let that go.
      I'm backing him, and I hold that goes. The Kid,&rdquo; he went on descriptively,
      addressing Father Wiliston, &ldquo;is what you see afore you, Elder. His mouth
      is hot, his hands is cold, his nerves is shaky, he's always feeling the
      cops gripping his shirt-collar. He didn't see no clergy around. He begs
      your pardon. Don't he? I says, don't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid a heavy red hand on the Newark Kid's shoulder, who wiped his
      pallid mouth with the back of his hand, smiled, and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boston Alley seemed in his way an agreeable man. He was tall and slender
      limbed, with a long, thin black mustache, sinewy neck and hollow chest,
      and spoke gently with a sweet, resonant voice, saying, &ldquo;Glad to see you,
      Elder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two wore better clothes than Toboso, but he seemed to dominate them
      with his red health and windy voice, his stomach and feet, and solidity of
      standing on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Wiliston stood the while gazing vaguely through his spectacles. The
      sense of happy freedom and congenial companionship that had been with him
      during the starlit walk had given way gradually to a stream of confused
      memories, and now these memories stood ranged about, looking at him with
      sad, faded eyes, asking him to explain the scene. The language of the
      Newark Kid had gone by him like a white hot blast. The past and present
      seemed to have about the same proportions of vision and reality. He could
      not explain them to each other. He looked up to Toboso, pathetically,
      trusting in his help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toboso stared surprised. &ldquo;I ain't on to you, Elder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was born here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed Toboso was a tower of strength even against the ghosts of other
      days, reproachful for their long durance in oblivion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Well, by Jinny! I reckon you'll give us lodging, Elder,&rdquo; he puffed
      cheerfully. He took the coincidence so pleasantly and naturally that
      Father Wiliston was comforted, and thought that after all it was pleasant
      and natural enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only furniture in the room was a high-backed settle and an overturned
      kitchen table, with one leg gone, and the other three helplessly in the
      air&mdash;so it had lain possibly many years. Boston Alley drew forward
      the settle and threw more broken clapboards on the fire, which blazed up
      and filled the room with flickering cheer. Soon the three outcasts were
      smoking their pipes and the conversation became animated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was a boy,&rdquo; said Father Wiliston&mdash;&ldquo;I remember so distinctly&mdash;there
      were remarkable early bough apples growing in the orchard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pot's yours, Elder,&rdquo; thundered To-boso. They went out groping under
      the old apple trees, and returned laden with plump pale green fruit.
      Boston Alley and the Newark Kid stretched themselves on the floor on heaps
      of pulled grass. Toboso and Father Wiliston sat on the settle. The juice
      of the bough apples ran with a sweet tang. The palate rejoiced and the
      soul responded. The Newark Kid did swift, cunning card tricks that filled
      Father Wiliston with wonder and pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young man, I don't see how you do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid was lately out of prison from a two years' sentence, &ldquo;only for
      getting into a house by the window instead of the door,&rdquo; as Boston Alley
      delicately explained, and the &ldquo;flies,&rdquo; meaning officers of the law, &ldquo;are
      after him again for reasons he ain't quite sure of.&rdquo; The pallor of slum
      birth and breeding, and the additional prison pallor, made his skin look
      curious where the grime had not darkened it. He had a short-jawed,
      smooth-shaven face, a flat mouth and light hair, and was short and stocky,
      but lithe and noiseless in movement, and inclined to say little. Boston
      Alley was a man of some slight education, who now sometimes sung in winter
      variety shows, such songs as he picked up here and there in summer
      wanderings, for in warm weather he liked footing the road better, partly
      because the green country sights were pleasant to him, and partly because
      he was irresolute and keeping engagements was a distress. He seemed
      agreeable and sympathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain't got no more real feelings 'n a fish,&rdquo; said Toboso, gazing
      candidly at Boston, but speaking to Father Wiliston, &ldquo;and yet he looks
      like he had 'em, and a man's glad to see him. Ain't seen you since fall,
      Boston, but I see the Kid last week at a hang-out in Albany. Well, gents,
      this ain't a bad lay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Toboso himself had been many years on the road. He was in a way a man of
      much force and decision, and probably it was another element in him,
      craving sloth and easy feeding, which kept him in this submerged society;
      although here, too, there seemed room for the exercise of his dominance.
      He leaned back in the settle, and had his hand on Father Wiliston's
      shoulder. His face gleamed redly over his bison beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good lay. And we're gay, Elder. Ain't we gay? Hey, Jinny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Toboso. But this young man&mdash;I'm sure he must have great
      talents, great talents, quite remarkable. Ah&mdash;yes, Jinny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Jinny,&rdquo; they sang together, &ldquo;Ho, Jinny! Listen, love, to me. I'll
      sing to you, and play to you, a dulcet melode-e-e&rdquo;&mdash;while Boston
      danced a shuffle and the Kid snapped the cards in time. Then, at Toboso's
      invitation and command, Boston sang a song, called &ldquo;The Cheerful Man,&rdquo;
       resembling a ballad, to a somewhat monotonous tune, and perhaps known in
      the music halls of the time&mdash;all with a sweet, resonant voice and a
      certain pathos of intonation:&mdash;

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Father Wiliston, &ldquo;don't you think really, Mr. Alley, that the
      moral is a little confused? I don't mean intentionally,&rdquo; he added, with
      anxious precaution, &ldquo;but don't you think he should have reflected&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Elder,&rdquo; said Toboso, with decision. &ldquo;It's like that. It
      ain't moral. When a thing ain't moral that settles it.&rdquo; And Boston nodded
      and looked sympathetic with every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sure you would agree with me,&rdquo; said Father Wiliston. He felt
      himself growing weary now and heavy-eyed. Presently somehow he was leaning
      on Toboso with his head on his shoulder. Toboso's arm was around him, and
      Toboso began to hum in a kind of wheezing lullaby, &ldquo;Hey, Jinny! Ho,
      Jinny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very grateful, my dear friends,&rdquo; murmured Father Wiliston. &ldquo;I have
      lived a long time. I fear I have not always been careful in my course, and
      am often forgetful. I think&rdquo;&mdash;drowsily&mdash;&ldquo;I think that happiness
      must in itself be pleasing to God. I was often happy before in this room.
      I remember&mdash;my dear mother sat here&mdash;who is now dead. We have
      been quite, really quite cheerful to-night. My mother&mdash;was very
      judicious&mdash;an excellent wise woman&mdash;she died long ago.&rdquo; So he
      was asleep before any one was aware, while Toboso crooned huskily, &ldquo;Hey,
      Jinny!&rdquo; and Boston Alley and the Newark Kid sat upright and stared
      curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Jims!&rdquo; said the Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toboso motioned them to bring the pulled grass. They piled it on the
      settle, let Father Wiliston down softly, brought the broken table, and
      placed it so that he could not roll off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Toboso, after a moment's silence, &ldquo;I guess we'd better pick
      him and be off. He's got sixty in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Boston, &ldquo;that's it, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my find, but seeing you's here I takes half and give you fifteen
      apiece.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I guess the Kid can take it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Kid found the pocketbook with sensitive gliding fingers, and pulled it
      out. Toboso counted and divided the bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; whispered Toboso thoughtfully, &ldquo;if the Elder now was forty years
      younger, I wouldn't want a better pardner.&rdquo; They tiptoed out into the
      night. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;looking at it that way, o' course he ain't
      got no great use for his wad and won't remember it till next week. Heeled
      all right, anyhow. Only, I says now, I says, there ain't no vice in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mammy tuck me up, no licks to-night,&rdquo; said the Kid, plodding in front. &ldquo;I
      ain't got nothing against him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Boston Alley only fingered the bills in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew quite dark in the room they had left as the fire sunk to a few
      flames, then to dull embers and an occasional darting spark. The only
      sound was Father Wiliston's light breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke the morning was dim in the windows. He lay a moment confused
      in mind, then sat up and looked around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me! Well, well, I dare say Toboso thought I was too old. I dare say&rdquo;&mdash;getting
      on his feet&mdash;&ldquo;I dare say they thought it would be unkind to tell me
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He wandered through the dusky old rooms and up and down the creaking
      stairs, picking up bits of recollection, some vivid, some more dim than
      the dawn, some full of laughter, some that were leaden and sad; then out
      into the orchard to find a bough apple in the dewy grasses; and, kneeling
      under the gnarled old tree to make his morning prayer, which included in
      petition the three overnight revellers, he went in fluent phrase and
      broken tones among eldest memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed cheerfully into the grassy road now, munching his apple and
      humming, &ldquo;Hey, Jinny! Ho, Jinny!&rdquo; He examined the tree at the highway with
      fresh interest. &ldquo;How singular! It means an empty house. Very intelligent
      man, Toboso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bits of grass were stuck on his back and a bramble dragged from his coat
      tail. He plodded along in the dust and wabbled absent-mindedly from one
      side of the road to the other. The dawn towered behind him in purple and
      crimson, lifted its robe and canopy, and flung some kind of glittering
      gauze far beyond him. He did not notice it till he reached the top of the
      hill above Ironville with Timothy's house in sight. Then he stopped,
      turned, and was startled a moment; then smiled companionably on the state
      and glory of the morning, much as on Toboso and the card tricks of the
      Newark Kid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;I have had a very good time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He met Timothy in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been out to walk early, father? Wait&mdash;there's grass and sticks on
      your coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It suddenly seemed difficult to explain the entire circumstances to
      Timothy, a settled man and girt with precedent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you enjoy it?&mdash;Letter you dropped? No, I haven't seen it.
      Breakfast is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither Bettina nor Mrs. Timothy had seen the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, my dear, no matter. I&mdash;really, I've had a very good
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterward he came out on the porch with his Bible and Concordance, sat
      down and heard Bettina brushing his hat and ejaculating, &ldquo;Fater!&rdquo;
       Presently he began to nod drowsily and his head dropped low over the
      Concordance. The chickens clucked drowsily in the road.

      ON EDOM HILL
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>HARLIE SEBASTIAN
      was a turfman, meaning that he had something to do with race-horses, and
      knew property as rolls of bank bills, of which one now and then suddenly
      has none at all; or as pacers and trotters that are given to breaking and
      unaccountably to falling off in their nervous systems; or as &ldquo;Association
      Shares&rdquo; and partnership investments in a training stable; all capable of
      melting and going down in one vortex. So it happened at the October races.
      And from this it arose that in going between two heated cities and low by
      the sea he stopped among the high hills that were cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a tall man with a pointed beard, strong of shoulder and foot, and
      without fear in his eyes. After two hours' riding he woke from a doze and
      argued once more that he was a &ldquo;phenomenally busted man.&rdquo; It made no
      difference, after all, which city he was in. Looking out at the white
      hills that showed faintly in the storm, it occurred to him that this was
      not the railway line one usually travelled to the end in view. It was
      singular, the little difference between choices. You back the wrong horse;
      then you drink beer instead of fizz, and the results of either are
      tolerable. Let a man live lustily and there's little to regret. He had
      found ruin digestible before, and never yet gone to the dogs that wait to
      devour human remnants, but had gotten up and fallen again, and on the
      whole rejoiced. Stomach and lungs of iron, a torrent of red blood in vein
      and artery maintain their consolations; hopes rise again, blunders and
      evil doings seem to be practically outlived. So without theory ran
      Sebastian's experience. The theory used to be that his sin would find a
      man out. There were enough of Sebastian's that had gone out, and never
      returned to look for him. So too with mistakes and failures. A little
      while, a year or more, and you are busy with other matters. It is a
      stirring world, and offers no occupation for ghosts. The dragging sense of
      depression that he felt seemed natural enough; not to be argued down, but
      thrown aside in due time. Yet it was a feeling of pallid and cold
      futility, like the spectral hills and wavering snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might as well go back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tossed a coin to see whether it was fated he should drop off at the
      next station, and it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ramoth!&rdquo; cried the brakeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastian held in his surprise as a matter of habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the platform in the drift and float of the snow-storm he stared
      around at the white January valley, at the disappearing train, at the sign
      above the station door, &ldquo;Ramoth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the place,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;There wasn't any railroad then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were hidden virtues in a flipped coin. Sebastian had his
      superstitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road to Ramoth village from the station curves about to the south of
      the great bare dome that is called Edom Hill, but Sebastian, without
      inquiry, took the fork to the left which climbed up the hill without
      compromise, and seemed to be little used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet in past times Edom Hill was noted in a small way as a hill that upheld
      the house of a stern abolitionist, and in a more secret way as a station
      in the &ldquo;underground railroad,&rdquo; or system by which runaway slaves were
      passed on to Canada. But when Charlie Sebastian remembered his father and
      Edom Hill, the days of those activities were passed. The abolitionist had
      nothing to exercise resistance and aggression on but his wind-blown farm
      and a boy, who was aggressive to seek out mainly the joys of this world,
      and had faculties of resistance. There were bitter clashes; young
      Sebastian fled, and came upon a stable on a stud farm, and from there in
      due time went far and wide, and found tolerance in time and wrote,
      offering to &ldquo;trade grudges and come to see how he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer, in a small, faint, cramped, unskilful hand, stated the
      abolitionist's death. &ldquo;Won't you come back, Mr. Sebastian. It is lonely.
      Harriet Sebastian.&rdquo; And therefore Sebastian remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet it is! Who's she? The old man must have married again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his new-found worldly tolerance he had admired such aggressive
      enterprise, but seeing no interest in the subject, had gone his way and
      forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beating up Edom Hill through the snow was no easier than twenty years
      before. David Sebastian had built his house in a high place, and looking
      widely over the top of the land, saw that it was evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drifts were unbroken and lay in long barrows and windy ridges over the
      roadway. The half-buried fences went parallel up the white breast and
      barren heave of the hill, and disappeared in the storm. Sebastian passed a
      house with closed blinds, then at a long interval a barn and a stiff red
      chimney with a snow-covered heap of ruins at its foot. The station was now
      some miles behind and the dusk was coming on. The broad top of the hill
      was smooth and rounded gradually. Brambles, bushes, reeds, and the tops of
      fences broke the surface of the snow, and beside these only a house by the
      road, looking dingy and gray, with a blackish bam attached, four old
      maples in front, an orchard behind. Far down the hill to the right lay the
      road to Ramoth, too far for its line of naked trees to be seen in the
      storm. The house on Edom Hill had its white throne to itself, and whatever
      dignity there might be in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not pause to examine the house, only noticed the faint smoke in one
      chimney, opened the gate, and pushed through untrodden snow to the side
      door and knocked. The woman who came and stood in the door surprised him
      even more than &ldquo;Ramoth!&rdquo; called by the brakeman. Without great reason for
      seeming remarkable, it seemed remarkable. He stepped back and stared, and
      the two, looking at each other, said nothing. Sebastian recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My feet are cold,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I shouldn't like to freeze them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew back and let him in, left him to find a chair and put his feet
      against the stove. She sat down near the window and went on knitting. The
      knitting needles glittered and clicked. Her face was outlined against the
      gray window, the flakes too glittered and clicked. It looked silent,
      secret, repressed, as seen against the gray window; like something chilled
      and snowed under, cold and sweet, smooth pale hair and forehead, deep
      bosom and slender waist. She looked young enough to be called in the early
      June of her years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's good proportion and feature, but not enough nerves for a
      thoroughbred. But,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;she looks as if she needed, as you might
      say, revelry,&rdquo; and he spoke aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once I was in this section and there was a man named Sebastian lived
      here, or maybe it was farther on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said, &ldquo;It was here&rdquo; in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;David Sebastian now, that was it, or something that way. Stiff, sort of
      grim old&mdash;oh, but you might be a relative, you see. Likely enough. So
      you might.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. You might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rubbed his hands and leaned back, staring at the window. The wind was
      rising outside and blew the snow in whirls and sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to be a bad night I came up from the station. If a man's going
      anywhere tonight, he'll be apt not to get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have taken the right hand at the fork.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose and took a cloak from the table. Sebastian watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must feed the pony and shut up the chickens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. A refusal seemed to have been hinted to the hinted request
      for hospitality. But Sebastian saw another point.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that's what I'm going to do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked on silently, as he passed her with assured step, not hesitating
      at doors, but through the kitchen to the woodshed, and there in the
      darkness of a pitch-black corner took down a jingling lantern and lit it.
      She followed him silently into the yard, that was full of drifts and wild
      storm, to the barn, where she listened to him shake down hay and bedding,
      measure oats, slap the pony's flank and chirp cheerfully. Then he plunged
      through a low door and she heard the bolt in the chicken shed rattle. It
      had grown dark outside. He came out and held the barn door, waiting for
      her to step out, and they stood side by side on the edge of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you know the lantern was there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lantern! Oh, farmhouses always keep the lantern in the nearest corner of
      the woodshed, if it isn't behind the kitchen door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she did not move to let him close the bam. He looked down at her a
      moment and then out at the white raging night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't see forty feet, can you? But, of course, if you don't want to give
      me a roof I'll have to take my chances. Look poor, don't they? Going to
      let me shut this door?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite alone here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. That's the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you understand,&rdquo; she said quietly, speaking in a manner
      low, cool, and self-contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got more understanding now than I'll have in an hour, maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lend you the lantern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mightn't get it back.&rdquo; He drew the barn door to, which forced her
      to step forward. A gust of wind about the corner of the bam staggered and
      threw her back. He caught her about her shoulders and held her steadily,
      and shot the bolt with the hand that held the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right. A man has to take his chances. I dare say a woman had
      better not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Sebastian exaggerated the dangers of the night, if there were any for
      him, looked at from her standpoint they might seem large and full of
      dread. The wind howled with wild hunting sound, and shrieked against the
      eaves of the house. The snow drove thick and blinding. The chimneys were
      invisible. A woman easily transfers her own feelings to a man and
      interprets them there. In the interest of that interpretation it might no
      longer seem possible that man's ingratitude, or his failings and passions,
      could be as unkind as winter wind and bitter sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will stay to supper,&rdquo; she said, and stepped aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. As I'm going, I'd better go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went before him across the yard, opened the woodshed door and stood in
      it. He held out the lantern, but she did not take it. He lifted it to look
      at her face, and she smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better go on, if I'm going. Am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very cold. Please come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went in and closed the doors against the storm. The house was wrapped
      round, and shut away from the sight of Edom Hill, and Edom Hill was
      wrapped round and shut away from the rest of the world.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>evelry has need of
      a certain co-operation. Sebastian drew heavily on his memory for
      entertainment, told of the combination that had &ldquo;cleaned him out,&rdquo; and how
      he might get in again in the Spring, only he felt a bit tired in mind now,
      and things seemed dead. He explained the mysteries of &ldquo;short prices,
      selling allowances, past choices, hurdles and handicaps,&rdquo; and told of the
      great October races, where Decatur won from Clifford and Lady Mary, and
      Lady Mary ran through the fence and destroyed the features of the jockey.
      But the quiet, smooth-haired woman maintained her calm, and offered
      neither question nor comment, only smiled and flushed faintly now and
      then. She seemed as little stirred by new tumultuous things as the white
      curtains at the windows, that moved slightly when the storm, which danced
      and shouted on Edom Hill, managed to force a whistling breath through a
      chink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastian decided she was frozen up with loneliness and the like. &ldquo;She's
      got no conversation, let alone revelry.&rdquo; He thought he knew what her life
      was like. &ldquo;She's sort of empty. Nothing doing any time. It's the off
      season all the year. No troubles. Sort of like a fish, as being chilly and
      calm, that lives in cold water till you have to put pepper on to taste it.
      I know how it goes on this old hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left him soon. He heard her moving about in the kitchen, and sometimes
      the clink of a dish. He sat by the stove and mused and muttered. She came
      and told him his room was on the left of the stair; it had a stove; would
      he not carry up wood and have his fire there? She seemed to imply a
      preference that he should. But the burden and oppression of his musings
      kept him from wondering when she had compromised her scruples and fears,
      or why she kept any of them. He mounted the stair with his wood. She
      followed with a lamp and left him. He stared at the closed door and rubbed
      his chin thoughtfully, then went to work with his fire. The house became
      silent, except for the outer tumult. She did not mount the stair again; it
      followed that she slept below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastian took a daguerreotype from the mantel and stared at it. It was
      the likeness of a shaven, grim-faced man in early middle life. He examined
      it long with a quizzical frown; finally went to the washstand, opened the
      drawer and took out a razor with a handle of yellow bone, carried the
      washstand to the stove, balanced the mirror against the pitcher, stropped
      the razor on his hand, heated water in a cup, slowly dismantled his face
      of beard and mustache, cast them in the stove, put the daguerreotype
      beside the mirror, and compared critically. Except that the face in the
      daguerreotype had a straight, set mouth, and the face in the mirror was
      one full-lipped and humorous and differently lined, they were nearly the
      same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't have believed it&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put it aside and looked around, whistling in meditation. Then he went
      back again to wondering who the pale-haired woman was. Probably the farm
      had changed hands. A man whose father had been dead going on twenty years
      couldn't have that kind of widowed stepmother. He was disqualified.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold, unchanging place, Edom Hill, lifted out of the warm, sapping
      currents of life. It might be a woman could keep indefinitely there,
      looking much the same. If her pulse beat once to an ordinary twice, she
      ought to last twice as long. The house seemed unchanged. The old things
      were in their old familiar places, David Sebastian's books on their
      shelves in the room below, on the side table there his great Bible, in
      which he used to write all family records, with those of his reforming
      activity. Sebastian wondered what record stood of his own flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat a few moments longer, then took his lamp and crept softly out of
      the room and down the stairs. The sitting-room was icily cold now; the
      white curtains stirred noiselessly. He sat down before the little side
      table and opened the great book.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were some thirty leaves between the Old and New Testaments, most of
      them stitched in. A few at the end were blank. Some of the records were
      obscure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March 5th, 1840. Saw light on this subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Others ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sept. 1 st, 1843. Rec. Peter Cavendish, fugitive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;July 5th, 1862. Rec. Keziah Andrews to keep my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dates of the entries from that point grew further apart, random and
      obscure; here and there a fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nov. 4th, 1876. Charles Sebastian departed.&rdquo;

      Sebastian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the last entry. A faint line ran down across the page connecting
      the end of &ldquo;Harriet&rdquo; with the beginning of &ldquo;Charles.&rdquo; Between the two
      blank leaves at the end was a photograph of himself at seventeen. He
      remembered suddenly how it was taken by a travelling photographer, who had
      stirred his soul with curiosity and given him the picture; and David
      Sebastian had taken it and silently put it away among blank leaves of the
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sebastian shivered. The written leaves, the look of himself of twenty
      years before, the cold, the wail of the wind, the clicking flakes on the
      window panes, these seemed now to be the dominant facts of life. Narrow
      was it, poor and meagre, to live and labor with a barren farm? The old
      abolitionist had cut deeper into existence than he had. If to deal with
      the fate of races, and wrestle alone with God on Edom Hill, were not
      knowledge and experience, what was knowledge or experience, or what should
      a man call worth the trial of his brain and nerve?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He passed me. He won hands down,&rdquo; he muttered, bending over the page
      again. &ldquo;'Rec. Harriet.' That's too much for me.&rdquo; And he heard a quick
      noise behind him and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood in the door, wide-eyed, smooth, pale hair falling over one
      shoulder, long cloak half slipped from the other, holding a shotgun,
      threatening and stem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out gunning for me?&rdquo; asked Sebastian gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared wildly, put the gun down, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're Charlie Sebastian!&rdquo; and fell on her knees beside the stove,
      choking, sobbing and shaking, crouching against the cold sheet iron in a
      kind of blind memory of its warmth and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still have the drop on me,&rdquo; said Sebastian.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered and crouched still and whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been here freezing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastian thrust anything inflammable at hand into the stove, lit it and
      piled in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not long. Only&mdash;only a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still have the advantage of me. Who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'm Harriet,&rdquo; she said simply, and looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. 'Received, 1877.' How old were you then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I was eight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. Don't tell lies, Harriet. You've been freezing a long while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew her cloak closer over the thin white linen of her gown with
      shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand. I'm very cold. Why didn't you come before? It has
      been so long waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he draft began to
      roar and the dampers to glow. She crept in front of the glow. He drew a
      chair and sat down close behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you come before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was startling, for Sebastian was only conscious of a lack of
      reason for coming. If David Sebastian had left him the farm he would have
      heard from it, and being prosperous, he had not cared. But the question
      seemed to imply some strong assumption and further knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better tell me about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About what? At the beginning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you anything except 'Received, Harriet'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hadn't any father or mother when Mr. Sebastian brought me here. Is
      that what you mean? But he taught me to say 'Harriet Sebastian,' and a
      great many things he taught me. Didn't you know? And about his life and
      what he wanted you to do? Because, of course, we talked about you nearly
      always in the time just before he died. He said you would be sure to come,
      but he died, don't you see? only a few years after, and that disappointed
      him. He gave me the picture and said, 'He'll come, and you'll know him by
      this,' and he said, 'He will come poor and miserable. My only son, so I
      leave him to you; and so, as I did, you will pray for him twice each day.'
      It was just like that, 'Tell Charles there is no happiness but in duty.
      Tell him I found it so.' It was a night like this when he died, and Kezzy
      was asleep in her chair out here, and I sat by the bed. Then he told me I
      would pay him all in that way by doing what he meant to do for you. I was
      so little, but I seemed to understand that I was to live for it, as he had
      lived to help free the slaves. Don't you see? Then he began calling,
      'Charles! Charles!' as if you were somewhere near, and I fell asleep, and
      woke and lay still and listened to the wind; and when I tried to get up I
      couldn't, because he held my hair, and he was dead. But why didn't you
      come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks odd enough now,&rdquo; Sebastian admitted, and wondered at the change
      from still impassiveness, pale and cool silence, to eager speech, swift
      question, lifted and flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you remember the letters? But you didn't come then. But I began to
      fancy how it would be when you came, and then somehow it seemed as if you
      were here. Out in the orchard sometimes, don't you see? And more often
      when Kezzy was cross. And when she went to sleep by the fire at night&mdash;she
      was so old&mdash;we were quite alone and talked. Don't you remember?&mdash;I
      mean&mdash;But Kezzy didn't like to hear me talking to myself. 'Mutter,
      mutter!' like that. 'Never was such a child!' And then she died, too,
      seven&mdash;seven years ago, and it was quite different. I&mdash;I grew
      older. You seemed to be here quite and quite close to me always. There was
      no one else, except&mdash;But, I don't know why, I had an aching from
      having to wait, and it has been a long time, hasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather long. Go on. There was no one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We lived here&mdash;I mean&mdash;it grew that way, and you changed
      from the picture, too, and became like Mr. Sebastian, only younger, and
      just as you are now, only&mdash;not quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with sudden fear, then dropped her eyes, drew her long
      hair around under her cloak and leaned closer to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is so much to tell you it comes out all mixed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sebastian sat silently looking down at her, and felt the burden of his
      thinking grow heavier; the pondering how David Sebastian had left him an
      inheritance of advice, declaring his own life full and brimming, and to
      Harriet the inheritance of a curious duty that had grown to people her
      nights and days with intense sheltered dreams, and made her life, too,
      seem to her full and brimming, multitudinous with events and interchanges,
      himself so close and cherished an actor in it that his own parallel
      unconsciousness of it had almost dropped out of conception. And the burden
      grew heavier still with the weight of memories, and the record between the
      Old and New Testaments; with the sense of the isolation and covert of the
      midnight, and the storm; with the sight of Harriet crouching by the fire,
      her story, how David Sebastian left this world and went out into the wild
      night crying, &ldquo;Charles! Charles!&rdquo; It was something not logical, but
      compelling. It forced him to remark that his own cup appeared partially
      empty from this point of view. Harriet seemed to feel that her hour had
      come and he was given to her hands.. Success even in methods of living is
      a convincing thing over unsuccess. Ah, well! too late to remodel to David
      Sebastian's notion. It was singular, though, a woman silent, restrained,
      scrupulous, moving probably to the dictates of village opinion&mdash;suddenly
      the key was turned, and she threw back the gates of her prison; threw open
      doors, windows, intimate curtains; asked him to look in and explore
      everywhere and know all the history and the forecasts; became simple,
      primitive, unrestrained, willing to sit there at his feet and as innocent
      as her white linen gown. How smooth and pale her hair was and gentle
      cheek, and there were little sleepy smiles in the corners of the lips. He
      thought he would like most of all to put out his hand and touch her cheek
      and sleepy smiles, and draw her hair, long and soft and pale, from under
      the cloak. On the whole, it seemed probable that he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harriet,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I'm going to play this hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't know what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it, I'm not over and above a choice selection. I don't mention
      details, but take it as a general fact. Would you want to marry that kind
      of a selection, meaning me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! Didn't you come for that? I thought you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought you needed revelry! You must have had a lot of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean. Listen! It keeps knocking at the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that's all right. Let it knock. Do you expect any more vagrants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vagrants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like you? You only came home. Listen! It was like this when he died. But
      he wouldn't come to-night and stand outside and knock, would he? Not
      to-night, when you've come at last. But he used to. Of course, I fancied
      things. It's the storm. There's no one else now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A thousand spectres go whirling across Edom Hill such winter nights and
      come with importunate messages, but if the door is close and the fire
      courageous, it matters little. They are but wind and drift and out in the
      dark, and if one is in the light, it is a great point to keep the door
      fast against them and all forebodings, and let the coming days be what
      they will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men are not born in a night, or a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if David Sebastian were a spectre there at the door, and thought
      differently on any question, or had more to say, he was not articulate.
      There is no occupation for ghosts in a stirring world, nor efficiency in
      their repentance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Has any one more than a measure of hope, and a door against the storm?
      There was that much, at least, on Edom Hill.

    <h2>
      SONS OF R. RAND
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OME years ago, of
      a summer afternoon, a perspiring organ-grinder and a leathery ape plodded
      along the road that goes between thin-soiled hillsides and the lake which
      is known as Elbow Lake and lies to the northeast of the village of Salem.
      In those days it was a well-travelled highway, as could be seen from its
      breadth and' dustiness. At about half the length of its bordering on the
      lake there was a spring set in the hillside, and a little pool continually
      rippled by its inflow. Some settler or later owner of the thin-soiled
      hillsides had left a clump of trees about it, making as sightly and
      refreshing an Institute of Charity as could be found. Another
      philanthropist had added half a cocoanut-shell to the foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organ-grinder turned in under the trees with a smile, in which his
      front teeth played a large part, and suddenly drew back with a guttural
      exclamation; the leathery ape bumped against his legs, and both assumed
      attitudes expressing respectively, in an Italian and tropical manner,
      great surprise and abandonment of ideas. A tall man lay stretched on his
      back beside the spring, with a felt hat over his face. Pietro, the
      grinder, hesitated. The American, if disturbed and irascible, takes by the
      collar and kicks with the foot: it has sometimes so happened. The tall man
      pushed back his hat and sat up, showing a large-boned and sun-browned
      face, shaven except for a black mustache, clipped close. He looked not
      irascible, though grave perhaps, at least unsmiling. He said: &ldquo;It's free
      quarters, Dago. Come in. Entrez. Have a drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pietro bowed and gesticulated with amiable violence. &ldquo;Dry!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Oh,
      hot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. That a friend of yours?&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the ape. &ldquo;He ain't
      got a withering sorrow, has he? Take a seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Elbow Lake is shaped as its name implies. If one were to imagine the arm
      to which the elbow belonged, it would be the arm of a muscular person in
      the act of smiting a peaceable-looking farmhouse a quarter of a mile to
      the east. Considering the bouldered front of the hill behind the house,
      the imaginary blow would be bad for the imaginary knuckles. It is a large
      house, with brown, unlikely looking hillsides around it, huckleberry knobs
      and ice-grooved boulders here and there. The land between it and the lake
      is low, and was swampy forty years ago, before the Rand boys began to
      drain it, about the time when R. Rand entered the third quarter century of
      his unpleasant existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      R. Rand was, I suppose, a miser, if the term does not imply too definite a
      type. The New England miser is seldom grotesque. He seems more like
      congealed than distorted humanity. He does not pinch a penny so hard as
      some of other races are said to do, but he pinches a dollar harder, and is
      quite as unlovely as any. R. Rand's methods of obtaining dollars to pinch
      were not altogether known, or not, at least, recorded&mdash;which accounts
      perhaps for the tradition that they were of doubtful uprightness. He held
      various mortgages about the county, and his farm represented little to him
      except a means of keeping his two sons inexpensively employed in rooting
      out stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the respective ages of sixteen and seventeen the two sons, Bob and Tom
      Rand, discovered the rooting out of stones to be unproductive labor, if
      nothing grew, or was expected to grow, in their place, except more stones;
      and the nature of the counsels they took may be accurately imagined. In
      the autumn of '56 they began ditching the swamp in the direction of the
      lake, and in the summer of '57 raised a crop of tobacco in the northeast
      corner, R. Rand, the father, making no comment the while. At the proper
      time he sold the tobacco to Packard &amp; Co., cigar makers, of the city
      of Hamilton, still making no comment, probably enjoying some mental
      titillation. Tom Rand then flung a rock of the size of his fist through
      one of the front windows, and ran away, also making no comment further
      than that. The broken window remained broken twenty-five years, Tom
      returning neither to mend it nor to break another. Bob Rand, by some
      bargain with his father, continued the ditching and planting of the swamp
      with some profit to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He evidently classed at least a portion of his father's manner of life
      among the things that are to be avoided. He acquired a family, and was in
      the way to bring it up in a reputable way. He further cultivated and
      bulwarked his reputation. Society, manifesting itself politically, made
      him sheriff; society, manifesting itself ecclesiastically, made him
      deacon. Society seldom fails to smile on systematic courtship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man continued to go his way here and there, giving account of
      himself to no one, contented enough no doubt to have one reputable son who
      looked after his own children and paid steady rent for, or bought piece by
      piece, the land he used; and another floating between the Rockies and the
      Mississippi, whose doings were of no importance in the village of Salem.
      But I doubt, on the whole, whether he was softened in heart by the
      deacon's manner or the ordering of the deacon's life to reflect unfilially
      on his own. Without claiming any great knowledge of the proprieties, he
      may have thought the conduct of his younger son the more filial of the
      two. Such was the history of the farmhouse between the years '56 and '82.
    </p>
    <p>
      One wet April day, the sixth of the month, in the year '82, R. Rand went
      grimly elsewhere&mdash;where, his neighbors had little doubt. With true
      New England caution we will say that he went to the cemetery, the little
      grass-grown cemetery of Salem, with its meagre memorials and absurd,
      pathetic epitaphs. The minister preached a funeral sermon, out of
      deference to his deacon, in which he said nothing whatever about R. Rand,
      deceased; and R. Rand, sheriff and deacon, reigned in his stead.

      failing the following condition: namely, I bequeath all my property as
      above mentioned, with the exception of this house and farm, to my son,
      Thomas Rand, provided, that within three months of the present date he
      returns and mends with his own hands the front window, third from the

      window, third from the north, having been in fact promptly replaced <i>by
      the hands of Deacon Rand himself</i>. The new pane stared defiantly across
      the lake, westward.

    </p>
    <p>
      Will be at Valley Station to-morrow. Meet me or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      T. Rand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon was a tall meagre man with a goatee that seemed to accentuate
      him, to hint by its mere straightness at sharp decision, an unwavering
      line of rectitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove westward in his buckboard that hot summer afternoon, the 6th of
      July. The yellow road was empty before him all the length of the lake,
      except for the butterflies bobbing around in the sunshine. His lips looked
      even more secretive than usual: a discouraging man to see, if one were to
      come to him in a companionable mood desiring comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite the spring he drew up, hearing the sound of a hand-organ under
      the trees. The tall man with a clipped mustache sat up deliberately and
      looked at him. The leathery ape ceased his funereal capers and also looked
      at him; then retreated behind the spring. Pietro gazed back and forth
      between the deacon and the ape, dismissed his professional smile, and
      followed the ape. The tall man pulled his legs under him and got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon it's Bob,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's free quarters, Bob. Entrez. Come in.
      Have a drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon's embarrassment, if he had any, only showed itself in an extra
      stiffening of the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train&mdash;I did not suppose&mdash;I was going to meet you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. I came by way of Wimberton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger brother stretched himself again beside the spring and drew his
      hat over his eyes. The elder stood up straight and not altogether
      unimpressive in front of it. Pietro in the rear of the spring reflected at
      this point that he and the ape could conduct a livelier conversation if it
      were left to them. Pietro could not imagine a conversation in which it was
      not desirable to be lively. The silence was long and, Pietro thought, not
      pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said the apparent sleeper at last, &ldquo;ever hear of the prodigal son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon frowned sharply, but said nothing. The other lifted the edge of
      his hat brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never heard of him? Oh&mdash;have I Then I won't tell about him. Too
      long. That elder brother, now, he had good points;&mdash;no doubt of it,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess I don't see your object&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't? Well, I was just saying he had good points. I suppose he and the
      prodigal had an average good time together, knockin' around, stubbin'
      their toes, fishin' maybe, gettin' licked at inconvenient times, hookin'
      apples most anytime. That sort of thing. Just so. He had something of an
      argument. Now, the prodigal had no end of fun, and the elder brother
      stayed at home and chopped wood; understood himself to be cultivating the
      old man. I take it he didn't have a very soft job of it?&rdquo;&mdash;lifting
      his hat brim once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon said nothing, but observed the hat brim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I think of it, maybe strenuous sobriety wasn't a thing he naturally
      liked any more than the prodigal did. I've a notion there was more family
      likeness between 'em than other folks thought. What might be your idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon still stood rigidly with his hands clasped behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would rather,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you would explain yourself without parable.
      You received my letter. It referred to our father's will. I have received
      a telegram which I take to be threatening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other sat up and pulled a large satchel around from behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a man of business, Bob,&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;I like you, Bob.
      That's so. That will&mdash;I've got it in my pocket. Now, Bob, I take it
      you've got some cards, else you're putting up a creditable bluff. I play
      this here Will, Codicil attached. You play,&mdash;window already mended;
      time expired at twelve o'clock to-night. Good cards, Bob&mdash;first-rate.
      I play here&rdquo;&mdash;opening the satchel&mdash;&ldquo;two panes of glass&mdash;allowin'
      for accidents&mdash;putty, et cetera, proposing to bust that window again.
      Good cards, Bob. How are you coming on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon's sallow cheeks flushed and his eyes glittered. Something came
      into his face which suggested the family likeness. He drew a paper from
      his inner coat pocket, bent forward stiffly and laid it on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sheriff's warrant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for&mdash;hem&mdash;covering possible
      trespassing on my premises; good for twenty-four hours' detention&mdash;hem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said his brother briskly. &ldquo;I admire you, Bob. I'll be blessed if I
      don't. I play again.&rdquo; He drew a revolver and placed it on top of the
      glass. &ldquo;Six-shooter. Good for two hours' stand-off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem,&rdquo; said the deacon. &ldquo;Warrant will be enlarged to cover the carrying of
      concealed weapons. Being myself the sheriff of this town, it is&mdash;hem&mdash;permissible
      for me.&rdquo; He placed a revolver on top of the warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; said his brother, in huge delight, &ldquo;I'm proud of you. But&mdash;I
      judge you ain't on to the practical drop. <i>Stand back there!</i>&rdquo; The
      deacon looked into the muzzle of the steady revolver covering him, and
      retreated a step, breathing hard. Tom Rand sprang to his feet, and the two
      faced each other, the deacon looking as dangerous a man as the Westerner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, the wheezy hand-organ beyond the spring began, seemingly trying
      to play two tunes at once, with Pietro turning the crank as desperately as
      if the muzzle of the revolver were pointed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, you monk! Dance!&rdquo; cried Pietro; and the leathery ape footed it
      solemnly. The perspiration poured down Pietro's face. Over the faces of
      the two stern men fronting each other a smile came and broadened slowly,
      first over the younger's, then over the deacon's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deacon's smile died out first. He sat down on a rock, hid his face and
      groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm an evil-minded man,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'm beaten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other cocked his head on one side and listened. &ldquo;Know what that tune
      is, Bob? I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the old place again, took up the panes of glass and the
      copy of the will, hesitated, and put them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't reckon you're beaten, Bob. You ain't got to the end of your hand
      yet. Got any children, Bob? Yes; said you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it a draw, Bob; I'll go you halves, counting in the monument.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the deacon only muttered to himself: &ldquo;I'm an evil-minded man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tom Rand meditatively wrapped the two documents around the revolvers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Dago, you drop 'em in the spring!&rdquo; which Pietro did, perspiring
      freely. &ldquo;Shake all that. Come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two walked slowly toward the yellow road. Pietro raised his voice
      despairingly. &ldquo;No cent! Not a nicka!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; said Tom, pausing. &ldquo;Five, by thunder! Come along, Dago. It's
      free quarters. Entrez. Take a seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The breeze was blowing up over Elbow Lake, and the butterflies bobbed
      about in the sunshine, as they drove along the yellow road. Pietro sat at
      the back of the buck-board, the leathery ape on his knee and a smile on
      his face, broad, non-professional, and consisting largely of front teeth.

      CONLON
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>ONLON, the strong,
      lay sick unto death with fever. The Water Commissioners sent champagne to
      express their sympathy. It was an unforced impulse of feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Conlon knew nothing of it. His lips were white, his cheeks sunken; his
      eyes glared and wandered; he muttered, and clutched with his big fingers
      at nothing visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor worked all day to force a perspiration. At six o'clock he said:
      &ldquo;I'm done. Send for the priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Kelly and Simon Harding came, Father Ryan and the doctor were going
      down the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis a solemn duty ye have, Kelly,&rdquo; said the priest, &ldquo;to watch the last
      moments of a dying man, now made ready for his end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, not Conlon! He'll not give up, not him,&rdquo; cried Kelly, &ldquo;the shtrong
      man wid the will in him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' what's the sthrength of man in the hands of his Creathor?&rdquo; said the
      priest, turning to Harding, oratorically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' know,&rdquo; said Harding, calmly. &ldquo;Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis naught!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelly murmured submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of monarchical institution, ain't it, what Conlon's run up against?&rdquo;
       Harding remarked. &ldquo;Give him a fair show in a caucus, an' he'd win, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll die if he don't sweat,&rdquo; said the doctor, wiping his forehead. &ldquo;It's
      hot enough.&rdquo; Conlon lay muttering and glaring at the ceiling. The big
      knuckles of his hands stood out like rope-knots. His wife nodded to Kelly
      and Harding, and went out. She was a good-looking woman, large, massive,
      muscular. Kelly looked after her, rubbing his short nose and blinking his
      watery eyes. He was small, with stooping shoulders, affectionate eyes,
      wavering knees. He had followed Conlon, the strong, and served him many
      years. Admiration of Conlon was a strenuous business in which to be
      engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;his wife ten year, an' me his inchimate friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was ten by the clock. The subsiding noise of the city came up over
      housetops and vacant lots. The windows of the sickroom looked off the
      verge of a bluff; one saw the lights of the little city below, the lights
      of the stars above, and the hot black night between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly and Harding sat down by a window, facing each other. The lamplight
      was dim. A screen shaded it from the bed, where Conlon muttered and cried
      out faintly, intermittently, as though in conversation with some one who
      was present only to himself. His voice was like the ghost or shadow of a
      voice, not a whisper, but strained of all resonance. One might fancy him
      standing on the bank of the deadly river and talking across to some one
      beyond the fog, and fancy that the voices would so creep through the fog
      stealthily, not leaping distances like earthly sounds, but struggling
      slowly through nameless obstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kelly rubbed his hands before the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was his inchimate friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding said: &ldquo;Are you going to talk like a blanked idiot all night, or
      leave off maybe about twelve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know ye for a hard man, too, Simmy,&rdquo; said Kelly, pathetically; &ldquo;an'
      'tis the nathur of men, for an Irishman is betther for blow-in' off his
      shteam, be it the wrath or the sorrow of him, an' the Yankee is betther
      for bottlin' it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uses it for driving his engine mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. But Conlon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conlon,&rdquo; said Harding slowly, &ldquo;that's so. He had steam to drive with, and
      steam to blow with, and plenty left over to toot his whistle and scald his
      fingers and ache in his belly. Expanding that there figure, he carried
      suction after him like the 1:40 express, he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis thrue.&rdquo; Kelly leaned forward and lowered his voice. &ldquo;I mind me when
      I first saw him I hadn't seen him before, unless so be when he was puttin'
      the wather-main through the sand-hills up the river an' bossin' a gang o'
      men with a fog-horn voice till they didn't own their souls, an' they
      didn't have any, what's more, the dirty Polocks. But he come into me shop
      one day, an' did I want the job o' plumbin' the court-house?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Have ye the court-house in your pocket?' says I, jokin'.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I have,' says he, onexpected, 'an' any plumbin' that's done for the
      court-house is done in the prisint risidence of the same.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I looks up, an' 'O me God!' I says to meself, ''tis a man!' wid the
      black eyebrows of him, an' the shoulders an' the legs of him. An' he took
      me into the shwale of his wake from that day to this. But I niver thought
      to see him die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so. You been his heeler straight through. I don't know but I like
      your saying so. But I don't see the how. Why, look here; when I bid for
      the old water contract he comes and offers to sell it to me, sort of
      personal asset. I don't know how. By the unbroke faces of the other Water
      Commissioners he didn't use his pile-driving fist to persuade 'em, and
      what I paid him was no more'n comfortable for himself. How'd he fetch it?
      How'd he do those things? Why, look here, Kelly, ain't he bullied you?
      Ain't you done dirty jobs for him, and small thanks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelly's hands trembled. He was bowed down and thoughtful, but not angry.
      &ldquo;Suppose I ask you what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose ye do. Suppose I don' know. Maybe he was born to be king over me.
      Maybe he wasn't. But I know he was a mastherful man, an' he's dyin' here,
      an' me blood's sour an' me bones sad wid thinkin' of it. Don' throuble me,
      Simmy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling, where the lamp
      made a nebulous circle of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's so,&rdquo; he said at last, in conclusion of some unmentioned train
      of thought. &ldquo;Why, I got a pup at home, and his affection ain't measured by
      the bones he's had, nor the licks he's had, not either of 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelly was deep in a reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor it ain't measured by my virtues. Look here, now; I don' see what his
      measure is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey?&rdquo; Kelly roused himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was just thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding thought he had known other men who had had in some degree a
      magnetic power that seemed to consist in mere stormy energy of initiative.
      They were like strong drink to weaker men. It was more physical than
      mental. Conlon was to Kelly a stimulant, then an appetite. And Conlon was
      a bad lot. Fellows that had heeled for him were mostly either wrecked or
      dead now. Why, there was a chap named Patterson that used to be decent
      till he struck Conlon, when he went pretty low; and Nora Reimer drowned
      herself on account of Patterson, when he got himself shot in a row at some
      shanty up the railroad. The last had seemed a good enough riddance. But
      Nora went off her head and jumped in the new reservoir. Harding remembered
      it the more from being one of the Water Company. They had had to empty the
      reservoir, which was expensive. And there were others. A black, blustering
      sort of beast, Conlon. He had more steam than was natural. Harding
      wondered vaguely at Kelly, who was spelling out the doctor's directions
      from a piece of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A powdher an' five dhrops from the short bottle. 'Tis no tin-course
      dinner wid the champagne an' entries he's givin' Conlon the night. Hey? A
      powdher an' five dhrops from the short bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding's mind wandered on among memories of the little city below, an
      intricate, irregular history, full of incidents, stories that were never
      finished or dribbled off anywhere, black spots that he knew of in white
      lives, white spots in dark lives. He did not happen to know any white
      spots on Conlon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Course if a man ain't in politics for his health he ain't in it for the
      health of the community, either, and that's all right. And if he opens the
      morning by clumping Mrs. Conlon on the head, why, she clumps him back more
      or less, and that's all right.&rdquo; Then, if he went down-town and lied here
      and there ingeniously in the way of business, and came home at night
      pretty drunk, but no more than was popular with his constituency, why,
      Conlon's life was some cluttered, but never dull. Still, Harding's own
      ways being quieter and less cluttered, he felt that if Conlon were going
      off naturally now, it was not, on the whole, a bad idea. It would conduce
      to quietness. It would perhaps be a pity if anything interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in a distant steeple struck twelve, a dull, unechoing sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simmy,&rdquo; said Kelly, pointing with his thumb, &ldquo;what do he be sayin',
      talkin'&mdash;talkin' like one end of a tiliphone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both turned toward the bed and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Telephone! Likely there's a party at the other end, then. Where's the
      other end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' know,&rdquo; whispered Kelly. &ldquo;But I have this in me head, for ye know,
      when the priest has done his last, 'tis sure he's dhropped his man at the
      front door of wherever he's goin', wid a letther of inthroduction in his
      hatband. An' while the man was waitin' for the same to be read an' him
      certified a thrue corpse, if he had a kettleful of boilin' impatience in
      himself like Tom Conlon, wouldn't he be passin' the time o' day through
      the keyhole wid his friends be-yant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't a telephone, then? It's a keyhole, hey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiliphone or keyhole, he'd be talkin' through it, Conlon would, do ye
      mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding looked with some interest. Conlon muttered, and stopped, and
      muttered again. Harding rose and walked to the bed. Kelly followed
      tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, will ye?&rdquo; said Kelly, suddenly leaning down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' know,&rdquo; said Harding, with an instinct of hesitation. &ldquo;I don' know
      as it's a square game. Maybe he's talkin' of things that ain't healthy to
      mention. Maybe he's plugged somebody some time, or broke a bank&mdash;ain't
      any more'n likely. What of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, will ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don' squat on a man when he's down, Kelly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Sh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hold Tom's hand. Wait for Tom</i>,&rdquo; babbled the ghostly voice, a thin,
      distant sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'd he say? What'd he say?&rdquo; Kelly was white and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding stood up and rubbed his chin reflectively. He did not seem to
      himself to make it out. He brought a chair, sat down, and leaned close to
      Conlon to study the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What's the heart-scald, mother?</i>&rdquo; babbled Conlon. &ldquo;<i>Where'd ye
      get it from? Me! Wirra!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tis spheakin' to ghosteses he is, Simmy, ye take me worrd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come off! He's harking back when he was a kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelly shook his head solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's spheakin' to ghosteses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What's that, mother? Arra! I'm sick, mother. What for? I don' see.
      Where'm I goin'?</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got me,&rdquo; muttered Harding. &ldquo;I don' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tom'll be good. It's main dark. Hold Tom's hand</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelly was on his knees, saying prayers at terrific speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear to him!&rdquo; he stopped to whisper. &ldquo;Ghosteses! Ora pro nobis&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tom ain't afraid. Naw, he ain't afraid.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding went back to his window. The air was heavy and motionless, the
      stars a little dim. He could see the dark line of the river with an
      occasional glint upon it, and the outline of the hills beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little city had drawn a robe of innocent obscurity over it. Only a
      malicious sparkle gleamed here and there. He thought he knew that city
      inside and out, from end to end. He had lived in it, dealt with it, loved
      it, cheated it, helped to build it, shared its fortunes. Who knew it
      better than he? But every now and then it surprised with some hidden
      detail or some impulse of civic emotion. And Kelly and Conlon, surely he
      knew them, as men may know men. But he never had thought to see Conlon as
      to-night. It was odd. But there was some fact in the social constitution,
      in human nature, at the basis of all the outward oddities of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe when a man's gettin' down to his reckonin' it's needful to show up
      what he's got at the bottom. Then he begins to peel off layers of himself
      like an onion, and 'less there ain't anything to him but layers, by and by
      he comes to something that resembles a sort of aboriginal boy, which is
      mostly askin' questions and bein' surprised.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maybe there was more boyishness in Conlon than in most men. Come to think
      of it, there was. Conlon's leadership was ever of the
      maybe-you-think-I-can't-lick-you order; and men followed him, admitting
      that he could, in admiration and simplicity. You might see the same thing
      in the public-school yard. Maybe that was the reason. The sins of Conlon
      were not sophisticated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The low, irregular murmur from the bed, the heavy heat of the night, made
      Harding drowsy. Kelly repeating the formula of his prayers, a kind of
      incantation against ghosts, Conlon with his gaunt face in the shadow and
      his big hands on the sheet clutching at nothing visible, both faded away,
      and Harding fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke with a start. Kelly was dancing about the bed idiotically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's shweatin'!&rdquo; he gabbled. &ldquo;He's shweatin'! He'll be well&mdash;Conlon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It made Harding think of the &ldquo;pup,&rdquo; and how he would dance about him, when
      he went home, in the crude expression of joy. Conlon's face was damp. He
      muttered no more. They piled the blankets on him till the perspiration
      stood out in drops. Conlon breathed softly and slept. Kelly babbled
      gently, &ldquo;Conlon! Conlon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harding went back to the window and rubbed his eyes sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kind of too bad, after all that trouble to get him peeled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The morning was breaking, solemn, noiseless, with lifted banners and wide
      pageantries, over river and city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harding yawned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's one on Father Ryan, anyway. That's a good thing. Blamed old
      windbag!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kelly murmured ecstatically, &ldquo;Conlon will get well&mdash;Conlon!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      ST CATHERINE'S
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>T. CATHERINE'S was
      the life work of an old priest, who is remembered now and presently will
      be forgotten. There are gargoyles over the entrance aside, with their
      mouths open to express astonishment. They spout rain water at times, but
      you need not get under them; and there are towers, and buttresses, a great
      clock, a gilded cross, and roofs that go dimly heavenward.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Catherine's is new. The neighborhood squats around it in different
      pathetic attitudes. Opposite is the saloon of the wooden-legged man; then
      the three groceries whose cabbages all look unpleasant; the parochial
      school with the green lattice; and all those little wooden houses&mdash;where
      lives, for instance, the dressmaker who funnily calls herself &ldquo;Modiste.&rdquo;
       Beyond the street the land drops down to the freight yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Father Connell died about the time they finished the east oriel, and
      Father Harra reigned over the house of the old man's dreams&mdash;a
      red-faced man, a high feeder, who looked as new as the church and said the
      virtues of Father Connell were reducing his flesh. That would seem to be
      no harm; but Father Harra meant it humorously. Father Connell had stumped
      about too much among the workmen in the cold and wet, else there had been
      no need of his dying at eighty-eight. His tall black hat became a relic
      that hung in the tiring room, and he cackled no more in his thin voice the
      noble Latin of the service. Peace to his soul! The last order he wrote
      related to the position of the Christ figure and the inscription, &ldquo;Come
      unto me, weary and heavy-laden: I will give you rest.&rdquo; But the figure was
      not in place till the mid-December following.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was the day before Christmas that Father Harra had a fine service,
      with his boy choir and all; and Chubby Locke sang a solo, &ldquo;Angels ever
      bright and fair,&rdquo; that was all dripping with tears, so to speak. Chubby
      Locke was an imp too. All around the altar the candles were lighted, and
      there hung a cluster of gas jets over the head of the Christ figure on the
      edge of the south transept. So fine it was that Father Harra came out of
      his room into the aisle (when the people were gone, saying how fine it
      was, and the sexton was putting out the gas here and there), to walk up
      and down and think about it, especially how he should keep up with the
      virtues of Father Connell. Duskier and duskier it grew, as the candles
      went out cluster by cluster till only those in the south transept were
      left; and Dennis, coming there, stopped and grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Father Harra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's asleep he is,&rdquo; said the sexton. &ldquo;It's a b'y, yer riverence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so it is! He went to sleep during the service. H'm&mdash;well&mdash;they
      often do that, Dennis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyways he don't belong here,&rdquo; said Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think so? I don't know about that. Wait a bit. I don't know about that
      Dennis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy lay curled up on the seat&mdash;a newsboy, by the papers that had
      slipped from his arms. But he did not look businesslike, and he did not
      suggest the advantages of being poor in America. One does not become a
      capitalist or president by going to church and to sleep in the best of
      business hours, from four to six, when the streets are stirring with men
      on their way to dinners, cigars and evening papers. The steps of St.
      Catherine's are not a bad place to sell papers after Vespers, and one
      might as well go in, to be sure, and be warm while the service lasts;
      only, as I said, if one falls asleep, one does not become a capitalist or
      president immediately. Father Harra considered, and Dennis waited
      respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's making plans I am against your natural rest, Dennis. I'm that
      inconsiderate of your feelings to think of keeping St. Catherine's open
      this night. And why? Look ye, Dennis. St. Catherine's is getting itself
      consecrated these days, being new, and of course&mdash;But I tell ye,
      Dennis, it's a straight church doctrine that the blessings of the poor are
      a good assistance to the holy wather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' me wid children of me own to be missin' their father this Christmas
      Eve!&rdquo; began Dennis indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wouldn't mind, the little villains, if their father had another
      dollar of Christmas morning to buy 'em presents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said the sexton, &ldquo;yer riverence is that persuadin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's plain enough for ye to see yourself, Dennis, though thick-headed
      somewhat. There you are: 'Come unto me, weary and heavy-laden;' and here
      he is. Plain enough. And who are the weary and heavy-laden in this city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer riverence will be meanin' everybody,&rdquo; chuckled Dennis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think so? Rich and poor and all? Stuff! I don't believe it. Not to-night.
      It'll be the outcasts, I'm thinking, Dennis. Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' the b'y, yer riverence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what? Oh, why, yes, yes. He's all right. I don't see anything the
      matter with him. He's come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was better weather to go with the wind than against it, for the snow
      drove in gritty particles, and the sidewalks made themselves disagreeable
      and apt to slip out from under a person. Little spurts of snow danced up
      St. Catherine's roofs and went off the ridgepoles in puffs. It ought to
      snow on Christmas Eve; but it rightly should snow with better manners and
      not be so cold. The groceries closed early. Freiburger, the saloon man,
      looked over the curtains of his window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know vat for Fater Harra tack up dings dis time by his kirch
      door, 'Come&mdash;come in here.' Himmel! der Irishman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Harra turned in to his supper, and thought how he would trouble
      Father Conner's reputation for enterprise and what a fine bit of
      constructive ability himself was possessed of.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great central door of St. Catherine's stood open, so that the drift
      blew in and piled in windrows on the cold floor of the vestibule. The tall
      front of the church went up into the darkness, pointing to no visible
      stars; but over the doors two gas jets flickered across the big sign they
      use for fairs at the parochial school. &ldquo;Come in here.&rdquo; The vestibule was
      dark, barring another gas jet over a side door, with another sign, &ldquo;Come
      in here,&rdquo; and within the great church was dark as well, except for a
      cluster over the Christ figure. That was all; but Father Harra thought it
      a neat symbol, looking toward those who go from meagre light to light
      through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little noises were in the church all night far up in the pitch darkness of
      rafter and buttress, as if people were whispering and crying softly to one
      another. Now and again, too, the swing door would open and remain so for a
      moment, suspicious, hesitating. But what they did, or who they were that
      opened it, could hardly be told in the dusk and distance. Dennis went to
      sleep in a chair by the chancel rail, and did not care what they did or
      who they were, granted they kept away from the chancel.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the wind blew!&mdash;and the snow tapped impatiently at stained
      windows with a multitude of little fingers. But if the noises among the
      rafters were not merely echoes of the crying and calling wind without, if
      any presences moved and whispered there, and looked down on flat floor and
      straight lines of pews, they must have seen the Christ figure, with
      welcoming hands, dominant by reason of the light about it; and, just on
      the edge of the circle of light, shapeless things stretched on cushions of
      pews, and motionless or stirring uneasily. Something now came dimly up the
      aisle from the swing door, stopped at a pew, and hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out!&rdquo; growled a hoarse voice. &ldquo;Dis my bunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The intruder gave a nervous giggle. &ldquo;Begawd!&rdquo; muttered the hoarse voice.
      &ldquo;It's a lady!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another voice said something angrily. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the first, &ldquo;it ain't
      behavin' nice to come into me boodwer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the giggle had slipped away and disappeared in a distant pew.
      In another pew to the right of the aisle a smaller shadow whispered to
      another:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmy, that's a statoo up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That. I bet 'e's a king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, no 'e ain't. Kings has crowns an' wallups folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gorry! What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don' know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other sighed plaintively. &ldquo;I thought 'e might be a king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rest were mainly silent. Some one had a bad cough. Once a sleeper
      rolled from the seat and fell heavily to the floor. There was an oath or
      two, a smothered laugh, and the distant owner of the giggle used it
      nervously. The last was an uncanny sound. The wakened sleeper objected to
      it. He said he would &ldquo;like to get hold of her,&rdquo; and then lay down
      cautiously on his cushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Architects have found that their art is cunning to play tricks with them;
      whence come whispering galleries, comers of echoes, roofs that crush the
      voice of the speaker, and roofs that enlarge it. Father Connell gave no
      orders to shape the roofs of St. Catherine's, that on stormy nights so
      many odd noises might congregate there, whispering, calling, murmuring,
      now over the chancel, now the organ, now far up in the secret high places
      of the roof, now seeming to gather in confidence above the Christ figure
      and the circle of sleepers; or, if one vaguely imagined some inquisitively
      errant beings moving overhead, it would seem that newcomers constantly
      entered, to whom it had all to be explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      But against that eager motion in the darkness above the Christ figure
      below was bright in his long garment, and quiet and secure. The cluster of
      gas jets over his head made light but a little distance around, then
      softened the dusk for another distance, and beyond seemed not to touch the
      darkness at all. The dusk was a debatable space. The sleepers all lay in
      the debatable space. They may have sought it by instinct; but the more one
      looked at them the more they seemed like dull, half-animate things, over
      whom the light and the darkness made their own compromises and the people
      up in the roof their own comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in the steeple struck the hours; in the church the tremble was
      felt more than the sound was heard. The chimes each hour started their
      message, &ldquo;Good will and peace;&rdquo; but the wind went after it and howled it
      down, and the snow did not cease its petulance at the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock in the steeple struck five. The man with the hoarse voice sat
      up, leaned over the back of the seat and touched his neighbor, who rose
      noiselessly, a huge fat man and unkempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to slope,&rdquo; whispered the first, motioning toward the chancel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other followed his motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're ignorance, you are. That's where they gives the show. There's
      pickin's there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two slipped out and stole up the aisle with a peculiar noiseless
      tread. Even Fat Bill's step could not be heard a rod away. The aisle
      entered the circle of light before the Christ figure; but the two thieves
      glided through without haste and without looking up. The smaller, in
      front, drew up at the end of the aisle, and Fat Bill ran into him. Dennis
      sat in his chair against the chancel rail, asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get onto his whiskers, Bill. Mebbe you'll have to stuff them whiskers
      down his throat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a nervous giggle behind them. Fat Bill shot into a pew, dragging
      his comrade after him, and crouched down. &ldquo;It ain't no use,&rdquo; he whispered,
      shaking the other angrily. &ldquo;Church business is bad luck. I alius said so.
      What's for them blemed noises all night? How'd come they stick that thing
      up there with the gas over it? What for'd they leave the doors open, an'
      tell ye to come in, an' keep their damn devils gigglin' around? 'Taint
      straight I won't stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a woman, Bill,&rdquo; said the other patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose on his knees and looked over the back of the seat. &ldquo;'Tain't
      straight. I won't stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won't fight, Bill. We'll get out, if you say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the giggle was sitting up, as they glided back, Fat Bill
      leading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll smash yer face,&rdquo; the smaller man said to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill turned and grabbed his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman stared stupidly after, till the swing door closed behind them.
      Then she put on her hat, decorated with too many disorderly flowers. Most
      of the sleepers were wakened. The wind outside had died in the night, and
      the church was quite still. A man in a dress suit and overcoat sat up in a
      pew beneath a window, and stared about him. His silk hat lay on the floor.
      He leaned over the back of the seat and spoke to his neighbor, a tramp in
      checked trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd I g-get here?&rdquo; he asked thickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don' know, pardner,&rdquo; said the tramp cheerfully. &ldquo;Floated in, same as me?&rdquo;
       He caught sight of the white tie and shirt front. &ldquo;Maybe you'd give a cove
      a shiner to steady ye out They don't give breakfasts with lodgin's here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman with the giggle and the broken-down flowers on her hat went out
      next; then a tall, thin man with a beard and a cough; the newsboy with his
      papers shuffled after, his shoes being too large; then a lame man&mdash;something
      seemed the matter with his hip; and a decent-looking woman, who wore a
      faded shawl over her head and kept it drawn across her face&mdash;she
      seemed ashamed to be there, as if it did not appear to her a respectable
      place; last, two boys, one of them small, but rather stunted than very
      young. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'E ain't a king, is 'e, Jimmy? You don' know who 'e is, do you, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Jimmy, it was warm, warn't it?&rdquo;

      Dennis came down the aisle, put out the gas, and began to brush the
      cushions. The clock struck a quarter of six, and Father Harra came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas, Dennis, Christmas! H'm&mdash;anybody been here? What did they
      think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dennis rubbed his nose sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wint to shleep, sor, an'&mdash;an' thin they wint out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Harra looked up at the Christ figure and stroked his red chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied they might see the point,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;Well, well, I hope
      they were warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The colored lights from the east oriel fell over the Christ figure and
      gave it a cheerful look; and from other windows blue and yellow and
      magical deep-sea tints floated in the air, as if those who had whispered
      unseen in the darkness were now wandering about, silent but curiously
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yer riverince,&rdquo; said Dennis, &ldquo;will not be forgettin' me dollar.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE SPIRAL STONE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE graveyard on
      the brow of the hill was white with snow. The marbles were white, the
      evergreens black. One tall spiral stone stood painfully near the centre.
      The little brown church outside the gates turned its face in the more
      comfortable direction of the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only three were out among the graves: &ldquo;Ambrose Chillingworth, ætat 30,
      1675;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret Vane, ætat 19, 1839;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thy Little One, O God, ætat 2,&rdquo; from
      the Mercer Lot. It is called the &ldquo;Mercer Lot,&rdquo; but the Mercers are all
      dead or gone from the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little One trotted around busily, putting his tiny finger in the
      letterings and patting the faces of the cherubs. The other two sat on the
      base of the spiral, which twisted in the moonlight over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder why it is?&rdquo; Margaret said. &ldquo;Most of them never come out at all.
      We and the Little One come out so often. You were wise and learned. I knew
      so little. Will you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learning is not wisdom,&rdquo; Ambrose answered. &ldquo;But of this matter it was
      said that our containment in the grave depended on the spirit in which we
      departed. I made certain researches. It appeared by common report that
      only those came out whom desperate sin tormented, or labors incomplete and
      great desire at the point of death made restless. I had doubts the matter
      were more subtle, the reasons of it reaching out distantly.&rdquo; He sighed
      faintly, following with his eyes, tomb by tomb, the broad white path that
      dropped down the hillside to the church. &ldquo;I desired greatly to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, too. Is it because we desired it so much, then? But the Little One&rdquo;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little One trotted gravely here and there, seeming to know very well
      what he was about, and presently came to the spiral stone. The lettering
      on it was new, and there was no cherub. He dropped down suddenly on the
      snow, with a faint whimper. His small feet came out from under his gown,
      as he sat upright, gazing at the letters with round troubled eyes, and up
      to the top of the monument for the solution of some unstated problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stone is but newly placed,&rdquo; said Ambrose, &ldquo;and the newcomer would
      seem to be of those who rest in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went and sat down on either side of him, on the snow. The peculiar
      cutting of the stone, with spirally ascending lines, together with the
      moon's illusion, gave it a semblance of motion. Something twisted and
      climbed continually, and vanished continually from the point. But the base
      was broad, square, and heavily lettered: &ldquo;John Mareschelli Vane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vane? That was thy name,&rdquo; said Ambrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      1890. Ætat 72.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Eminent Citizen, a Public Benefactor, and Widely Esteemed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the Love of his Native Place returned to lay his Dust therein.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Just Made Perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem he did well, and rounded his labors to a goodly end, lying
      down among his kindred as a sheaf that is garnered in the autumn. He was
      fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret spoke, in the thin, emotionless voice which those who are
      long in the graveyard use: &ldquo;He was my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy brother?&rdquo; said Ambrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Little One looked up and down the spiral with wide eyes. The other two
      looked past it into the deep white valley, where the river, covered with
      ice and snow, was marked only by the lines of skeleton willows and
      poplars. A night wind, listless but continual, stirred the evergreens. The
      moon swung low over the opposite hills, and for a moment slipped behind a
      cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Says it not so, 'For the Love of his Native Place'?&rdquo; murmured Ambrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the moon came out, there leaned against the pedestal, pointing with
      a finger at the epitaph, one that seemed an old man, with bowed shoulders
      and keen, restless face, but in his manner cowed and weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a lie,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I hated it, Margaret. I came because Ellen
      Mercer called me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ellen isn't buried here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it you, then, Margaret? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't call you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who then?&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;Who called me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The night wind moved on monotonously, and the moonlight was undisturbed,
      like glassy water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came away,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I thought you would marry her. You didn't,
      then? But why should she call you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I left the village suddenly!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I grew to dread, and then to
      hate it. I buried myself from the knowledge of it, and the memory of it
      was my enemy. I wished for a distant death, and these fifty years have
      heard the summons to come and lay my bones in this graveyard. I thought it
      was Ellen. You, sir, wear an antique dress; you have been long in this
      strange existence. Can you tell who called me? If not Ellen, where is
      Ellen?&rdquo; He wrung his hands, and rocked to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mystery is with the dead as with the living,&rdquo; said Ambrose. &ldquo;The
      shadows of the future and the past come among us. We look in their eyes,
      and understand them not. Now and again there is a call even here, and the
      grave is henceforth untenanted of its spirit. Here, too, we know a
      necessity which binds us, which speaks not with audible voice and will not
      be questioned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; moaned the other, &ldquo;does the weight of sin depend upon its
      consequences? Then what weight do I bear? I do not know whether it was
      ruin or death, or a thing gone by and forgotten. Is there no answer here
      to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death is but a step in the process of life,&rdquo; answered Ambrose. &ldquo;I know
      not if any are ruined or anything forgotten. Look up, to the order of the
      stars, an handwriting on the wall of the firmament. But who hath read it?
      Mark this night wind, a still small voice. But what speaketh it? The earth
      is clothed in white garments as a bride. What mean the ceremonials of the
      seasons? The will from without is only known as it is manifested. Nor does
      it manifest where the consequences of the deed end or its causes began.
      Have they any end or a beginning? I cannot answer you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who called me, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she said again monotonously, &ldquo;I didn't call you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Little One sat between Ambrose and Margaret, chuckling to himself and
      gazing up at the newcomer, who suddenly bent forward and looked into his
      eyes, with a gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;'Thy Little One, O God, ætat 2,' from the
      Mercer Lot,&rdquo; returned Ambrose gently. &ldquo;He is very quiet. Art not
      neglecting thy business, Little One? The lower walks are unvisited
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are Ellen's eyes!&rdquo; cried the other, moaning and rocking. &ldquo;Did you
      call me? Were you mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, written, 'Thy Little One, O God,'&rdquo; murmured Ambrose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Little One only curled his feet up under his gown, and now
      chuckled contentedly.

      THE MUSIDORA SONNET
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE clock in some
      invisible steeple struck one. The great snowflakes fell thickly, wavering
      and shrinking, delicate, barren seeds, conscious of their unfruitfulness.
      The sputter of the arc lights seemed explosive to the muffled silence of
      the street. With a bright corner at either end, the block was a canon, a
      passage in a nether world of lurking ghosts, where a frightened gaslight
      trembled, hesitated midway. And Noel Endicott conceived suddenly, between
      curb and curb, a sonnet, to be entitled &ldquo;Dante in Tenth Street,&rdquo; the
      appearance of it occupying, in black letter, a half page in the <i>Monthly
      Illustrated</i>, a gloomy pencilling above, and below it &ldquo;Noel Endicott.&rdquo;
       The noiselessness of his steps enlarged his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I walked in 19th Street, not the Florentine,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      With ghosts more sad, and one like Beatrice
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Laid on my lips the sanction of her kiss.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Twas&mdash;&mdash;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be in a purgatorial key, in effect something cold, white and
      spiritual, portraying &ldquo;her&rdquo; with Dantesque symbolism, a definite being, a
      vision with a name. &ldquo;'Twas&mdash;&rdquo; In fact, who was she?
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. Tenth Street was worth more than a sonnet's confined
      austerity. It should be a story. Noel was one who beat tragic conceptions
      into manuscript, suffering rejection for improbability. Great actions
      thrilled him, great desires and despairs. The massive villainies of Borgia
      had fallen in days when art was strenuous. Of old, men threw a world away
      for a passion, an ambition. Intense and abundant life&mdash;one was
      compelled now to spin their symbols out of thin air, be rejected for
      improbability, and in the midst of a bold conception, in a snowstorm on
      canoned Tenth Street, be hungry and smitten with doubts of one's landlady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Tibbett had been sharp that morning relative to a bill, and he had
      remonstrated but too rashly: &ldquo;Why discuss it, Mrs. Tibbett? It's a
      negative, an unfruitful subject.&rdquo; And she had, in effect, raved, and
      without doubt now had locked the outer door. Her temper, roused at one
      o'clock, would be hasty in action, final in result.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood still and looked about him. Counting two half blocks as one, it
      was now one block to Mrs. Tibbett and that ambushed tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his last novel, &ldquo;The Sunless Treasure&rdquo; (to his own mind his greatest),
      young Humphrey stands but a moment hesitating before the oaken door,
      believing his enemies to be behind it with ready daggers. He hesitates but
      a moment. The die is cast. He enters. His enemies are not there. But Mrs.
      Tibbett seemed different. For instance, she would be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house frontage of this, like the house frontage of the fatal next
      block, was various, of brick, brownstone or dingy white surface, with
      doorways at the top of high steps, doorways on the ground level, doorways
      flush with the front, or sunken in pits. Not a light in any window, not a
      battlement that on its restless front bore a star, but each house stood
      grim as Child Roland's squat tower. The incessant snowflakes fell past, no
      motion or method of any Byzantine palace intrigue so silken, so noiseless,
      so mysterious in beginnings and results. All these locked caskets wedged
      together contained problems and solutions, to which Bassanio's was a
      simple chance of three with a pointed hint. Noel decided that Tenth Street
      was too large for a story. It was a literature. One must select.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the snow fell and lay thickly, and there was no doubt that by
      persistent standing in the snow one's feet became wet. He stepped into the
      nearest doorway, which was on the level of the street, one of three
      doorways alike, all low, arched and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would be less noticeable in the daytime than in the night, when their
      cavernous gaping and exact repetition seemed either ominous or grotesque,
      according to the observer. The outer door was open. He felt his way in
      beyond the drift to the hard footing of the vestibule, kicked his shoes
      free of snow and brushed his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heroes of novels were sometimes hungry and houseless, but it seemed to
      Noel that they seldom or never faced a problem such as Mrs. Tibbett
      presented. Desperate fortunes should be carried on the point of one's
      sword, but with Mrs. Tibbett the point was not to provoke her. She was
      incongruous. She must be thrust aside, put out of the plot. He made a
      gesture dismissing Mrs. Tibbett. His hand in the darkness struck the jamb
      of the inner door, which swung back with a click of the half-caught latch.
      His heart thumped, and he peered into the darkness, where a thin yellow
      pencil of light stretched level from a keyhole at the farther end of a
      long hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dismissing Mrs. Tibbett, it was a position of dramatic advantage to stand
      in so dark and deep an arched entrance, between the silence and incessant
      motion of the snow on the one hand, and the yellow pencil of light,
      pointing significantly to something unknown, some crisis of fortune. He
      felt himself in a tale that had both force and form, responsible for its
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped in, closed the half door behind him softly, and crept through
      the hall. The thin line of light barred the way, and seemed to say, &ldquo;Here
      is the place. Be bold, ready-minded, full of subtlety and resource.&rdquo; There
      was no sound within that he could hear, and no sound without, except his
      own oppressed breathing and pulses throbbing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faint heart never won anything, and as for luck, it belonged to those who
      adventured with various chances, and of the blind paths that led away from
      their feet into the future, chose one, and another, and so kept on good
      terms with possibility. If one but cried saucily, &ldquo;Open this odd little
      box, you three gray women!&rdquo; And this, and this the gray Fates smiled
      indulgently, showing a latent motherliness. How many destinies had been
      decided by the opening and shutting of a door, which to better or worse,
      never opened again for retreat? A touch on this door and Mrs. Tibbett
      might vanish from the story forever, to the benefit of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his hand, having in mind to tap lightly, with tact and
      insinuation, but struck the door, in fact, nervously, with a bang that
      echoed in the hall. Some one spoke within. He opened and made entry in a
      prepared manner, which gave way to merely blinking wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a large dining-room, brightly lit by a chandelier, warm from a
      glowing grate, sumptuous with pictures and hangings, on the table a
      glitter of glass and silver, with meat, cakes and wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the farther side of the table stood a woman in a black evening dress,
      with jewels on her hair and bosom. She seemed to have just risen, and
      grasped the back of her chair with one hand, while the other held open a
      book on the table. The length of her white arm was in relief against her
      black dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel's artistic slouch hat, now taken off with uncertain hand, showed wavy
      brown hair over eyes not at all threatening, a beard pointed, somewhat
      profuse, a face interestingly featured and astonished. No mental
      preparation to meet whatever came, of Arabic or mediaeval incident,
      availed him. He felt dumb, futile, blinking. The lady's surprise, the
      startled fear on her face, was hardly seen before it changed to relief, as
      if the apparition of Noel, compared with some foreboding of her own, were
      a mild event. She half smiled when he began:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an intruder, madam,&rdquo; and stopped with that embarrassed platitude. &ldquo;I
      passed your first door by accident, and your second by impulse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't explain why you stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I stay to explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When two have exchanged remarks that touch the borders of wit, they have
      passed a mental introduction. To each the mind of the other is a possible
      shade and bubbling spring by the dusty road of conversation. Noel felt the
      occasion. He bowed with a side sweep of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I am a writer of poems, essays, stories. If you ask, What do I
      write in poems, essays, stories, I answer, My perception of things. If you
      ask, In what form would I cast my present perceptions of things, I say,
      Without doubt a poem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are able to carry both sides of a conversation. I have not asked any
      of these.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have asked why I stay. I am explaining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady's attitude relaxed its stiffness by a shade, her half smile
      became a degree more balmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must be a successful writer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You touch the point,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I am not. I am hungry and probably
      houseless. And worse than that, I find hunger and houselessness are
      sordid, tame. The taste of them in the mouth is flat, like stale beer. It
      is not like the bitter tang of a new experience, but like something the
      world shows its weariness of in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The amused smile vanished in large-eyed surprise, and something more than
      surprise, as if his words gave her some intimate, personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say strange things in a very strange way. And you came in by an
      accident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And an impulse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand. But you must sit down, and I can find you more to
      eat, if this isn't enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel could not have explained the strangeness of his language, if it was
      strange, further than that he felt the need of saying something in order
      to find an opportunity of saying something to the point, and so digplayed
      whatever came to his mind as likely to arrest attention. It was a critical
      lesson in vagabondage, as familiar there as hunger and houselessness. He
      attacked the cold meat, cakes and fruit with fervor, and the claret in the
      decanter. But what should be the next step in the pursuit of fortune? At
      this point should there not come some revelation?
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady did not seem to think so, but sat looking now at Noel and now at
      her own white hands in her lap. That she should have youth and beauty
      seemed to Noel as native to the issue as her jewels, the heavy curtains,
      the silver and glass. As for youth, she might be twenty, twenty-one, two.
      All such ages, he observed to himself with a mental flourish, were one in
      beauty. It was not a rosy loveliness like the claret in the decanter, nor
      plump like the fruit in the silver basket, but dark-eyed, white and
      slender, with black hair drawn across the temples; of a fragile delicacy
      like the snowflakes, the frost flower of the century's culture, the symbol
      of its ultimate luxury. The rich room was her setting. She was the center
      and reason for it, and the yellow point of a diamond over her heart,
      glittering, but with a certain mellowness, was still more central,
      intimate, interpretative, symbolic of all desirable things. He began to
      see the story in it, to glow with the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a writer of whose importance I have not as yet
      been able to persuade the public. The way I should naturally have gone
      to-night seemed to me something to avoid. I took another, which brought me
      here. The charm of existence&mdash;&rdquo; She seemed curiously attentive. &ldquo;The
      charm of existence is the unforeseen, and of all things our moods are the
      most unforeseen. One's plans are not always and altogether futile. If you
      propose to have salad for lunch, and see your way to it, it is not so
      improbable that you will have salad for lunch. But if you prefigure how it
      will all seem to you at lunch, you are never quite right. Man proposes and
      God disposes. I add that there is a third and final disposal, namely, what
      man is to think of the disposition after it is made. I hope, since you
      proposed or prefigured to-night, perhaps as I did, something different
      from this&mdash;this disposition&rdquo;&mdash;he lifted his glass of claret
      between him and the light&mdash;&ldquo;that your disposition what to think of it
      is, perhaps, something like mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady was leaning forward with parted lips, listening intently,
      absorbed in his words. For the life of him Noel could not see why she
      should be absorbed in his words, but the fact filled him with happy pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;You speak so well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel filled in her pause of hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means that my wisdom may be all in my mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed! I mean you must have experience. Will you tell me, is it so
      dreadful not to have money? People say different things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do.&rdquo; He felt elevated, borne along on a wave of ornamental
      expression. &ldquo;It is their salvation. Their common proverbs contradict each
      other. A man looks after his pence and trusts one proverb that the pounds
      will look after themselves, till presently he is called penny wise and
      pound foolish, and brought up by another. And consider how less noticeable
      life would be without its jostle of opinion, its conflicting lines of
      wisdom, its following of one truth to meet with another going a different
      way. Give me for finest companionship some half truth, some ironic
      veracity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. It came to him with a shock that it was not his
      ornamental expression which interested her, but only as it might bear on
      something in her own mind more simple, direct and serious, something not
      yet disclosed. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;she is right. One must get on with
      the plot&rdquo; It was a grievous literary fault to break continuity, to be led
      away from the issue by niceties of expression. The proper issue of a plot
      was simple, direct, serious, drawn from the motive which began it. Why did
      she sit here with her jewels, her white arms and black dress these weird,
      still hours of the night? Propriety hinted his withdrawal, but one must
      resist the commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The answer to the question does not satisfy you. But do you not see that
      I only enlarged on your own answer? People say different things because
      they are different. The answer depends on temperaments, more narrowly on
      moods; on tenses, too, whether it is present poverty and houselessness or
      past or future. And so it has to be answered particularly, and you haven't
      made me able to answer it particularly to you. And then one wouldn't
      imagine it could be a question particular to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very clever,&rdquo; she murmured, half smiling again. &ldquo;Are you not too
      clever for the purpose? You say so many things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Noel plaintively. &ldquo;The story has come to a
      standstill. It has all run out into diction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment there was a loud noise in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile, which began hopefully, grew old while he watched it, and
      withered away. The noise that echoed in the hall was of a banging door,
      then of laden, dragging steps. The hall door was thrown open, and two
      snowy hackmen entered, holding up between them a man wearing a tall hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's some loaded, ma'am,&rdquo; said one of them cheerfully. &ldquo;I ain't seen him
      so chucked in six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dropped him in a chair, from which, after looking about him with
      half-open, glassy eyes, and closing them again, he slid limply to the
      floor. The hackman regarded that choice of position with sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wants to rest his load, he does,&rdquo; and backed out of the door with his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes on the bill. Ain't seen him so chucked in six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lady had not moved from her chair, but had sat white and still,
      looking down into her lap. She gave a hard little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it nice he's so 'chucked'? He would have acted dreadfully.&rdquo; She was
      leaning on the table now, her dark eyes reading him intently. The man on
      the floor snorted and gurgled in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't kill anybody,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so funny,&rdquo; she went on in a soft, speculative way, &ldquo;one can't do it.
      I'm afraid to go away and be alone and poor. I wish he would die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't work out that way,&rdquo; said Noel, struggling with his wits.
      &ldquo;He's too healthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him immediately that the comment was not the right one. It
      was not even an impersonal fact to himself, an advantage merely to the
      plot, that the sleeper was unable to object to him and discard him from
      it, as he had resolved to discard Mrs. Tibbett, but with such brutal
      energy as the sleeper's face indicated. For it repelled not so much by its
      present relaxed degradation as by its power, its solidity of flesh, its
      intolerant self-assertion, the physical vigor of the short bull neck,
      bulky shoulders, heavy mustache, heavy cheeks and jaw, bluish with the
      shaving of a thick growth. He was dressed, barring his damp dishevelment,
      like a well-groomed clubman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lady was looking Noel in the eyes, and her own seemed strangely
      large, but as if covering a spiritual rather than a physical space,
      settled in melancholy, full of clouds, moving lights and dusky distances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was waiting for him because he ordered me. I'm so afraid of him,&rdquo; she
      said, shrinking with the words. &ldquo;He likes me to be here and afraid of
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what I am to do?&rdquo; he said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are not to do anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noel caught the thread of his fluency. He drew a ten-cent piece from his
      pocket, tossed it on the table, gestured toward it with one hand and swung
      the other over the back of his chair with an air of polished recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your case seems desperate to you. Is it more than mine? You have
      followed this thing about to 'the end of the passage,' and there is my
      last coin. My luck might change to-morrow. Who knows? Perhaps tonight. I
      would take it without question and full of hope. Will you experiment with
      fortune and&mdash;and me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dark eyes neither consented nor refused. They looked at him gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a black, cold night. The snow is thick in the air and deep on the
      street Put it so at the worst, but fortune and wit will go far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wit goes farther than your fortune, doesn't it?&rdquo; she said, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't conceal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't conceal either of them, do you? You spread them both out,&rdquo; and
      she laughed a pleasant little ripple of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel rose with distinction and bent toward her across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fortune is this ten-cent piece. As you see, on the front of it is
      stamped a throned woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how clever.&rdquo; She laughed, and Noel flushed with the applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we trust fortune and spin the coin? Heads, the throned woman, I
      shall presently worship you, an earthly divinity. Tails, a barren wreath
      and the denomination of a money value, meaning I take my fortunes away,
      and you,&rdquo; pointing in turn to the sleeper and the jewels, &ldquo;put up with
      yours as you can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to shiver as he pointed. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I couldn't do that. A
      woman never likes to spin a coin seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sleeper grunted and turned over. She turned pale, put her hand to her
      throat, said hurriedly, &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; and left the room, lifting and
      drawing her skirt aside as she passed the sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door at last and came again, wrapped in a fur mantle,
      carrying a travelling case, and stood looking down at the sleeper as if
      with some struggle of the soul, some reluctant surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went out, shutting the door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow was falling still on Tenth Street, out of the crowding night. He
      held her hand on his arm close to him. She glided beside him noiselessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The express office was at the corner, a little dingy, gas-lit room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carriage? Get it in a minute,&rdquo; said the sleepy clerk. &ldquo;It's just round
      the corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stood together by a window, half opaque with dust. Her face was
      turned away, and he watched the slant of her white cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have so much to tell me,&rdquo; he whispered at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really very grateful. You helped me to resolve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your carriage, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The electric light sputtered over them standing on the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, smiling up at him, &ldquo;I have nothing to tell you. There is
      nothing more. It ends here. Forgive me. It is my plot and it wouldn't work
      out your way. There are too many conflicting lines of wisdom in your way.
      My life lately has been what you would call, perhaps, a study in realism,
      and you want me to be, perhaps, a symbolic romance. I am sure you would
      express it very cleverly. But I think one lives by taking resolutions
      rather than by spinning coins, which promise either a throned woman, or a
      wreath and the denomination of a money value. One turns up so much that is
      none of these things. Men don't treat women that way. I married to be
      rich, and was very wretched, and perhaps your fame, when it comes, will be
      as sad to you. Perhaps the trouble lies in what you called 'the third
      disposal.' But I did not like being a study in realism. I should not mind
      being something symbolic, if I might prove my gratitude&rdquo;&mdash;she took
      her hand from his arm, put one foot on the step and laughed, a pleasant
      little ripple of sound&mdash;&ldquo;by becoming literary material.&rdquo; The door
      shut to, and the carriage moved away into the storm with a muffled roll of
      wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noel stared after it blankly, and then looked around him. It was half a
      block now to Mrs. Tibbett. He walked on mechanically, and mounted the
      steps by habit. The outer door was not locked. A touch of compunction had
      visited Mrs. Tibbett.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crept into his bed, and lay noting the growing warmth and sense of
      sleep, and wondering whether that arched doorway was the third of the
      three or the second. Strictly speaking he seemed to have gone in at the
      middle one and come out at the third, or was it not the first rather than
      the middle entrance that he had sheltered in? The three arched entrances
      capered and contorted before him in the dark, piled themselves into the
      portal of a Moorish palace, twisted themselves in a kind of mystical
      trinity and seal of Solomon, floated apart and became thin, filmy,
      crescent moons over a frozen sea. He sat up in bed and smote the coverlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know her name! She never told me!&rdquo; He clutched his hair, and then
      released it cautiously. &ldquo;It's Musidora! I forgot that sonnet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Twas Musidora, whom the mystic nine
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">

      And, as through shadows manifold of Dis,

    <p class="indent15">

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
